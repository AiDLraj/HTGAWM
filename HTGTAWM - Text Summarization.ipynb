Obviously, your office has them since, as | understand it, your staff made the initial edits. -We would like to have an inventory of the discovery provided to Judge Lester for his in camera review and how it got to him if you didn’t deliver it to him personally. -Also, we still don’t have color images of the cell phone pictures taken of the back of Zimmerman’s head, the flashlight found nearby and of Trayvon Martin laying facedown the night of the shooting. took these pictures according to discovery reports and provided them to law enforcement. -As well, we don’t have the color image of Zimmerman’s face that Ofc. We need that in order to move forward with the depos of the FDLE personnel. -We don’t have the SIM card information from Trayvon Martin’s phone that was downloaded by FDLE analyst Steve Brenton that he talked about at the evidence viewing, nor have | seen any report prepared by him. | can’t remember where that stands, | don’t think you gave us any of them at the evidence review. We need another copy and | apologize if you gave them to us at the evidence review and I’ve misplaced them. | want you to provide us with their actual addresses so we can conduct our own investigation. | am not opposed to maintaining their privacy with the public and am not asking you to file a discovery response with their addresses. You can file a sealed pleading or just give them to us and we will keep the information confidential if you want. | wasn’t clear from our conversation at the evidence viewing whether or not the Facebook accounts and Twitter accounts of Trayvon Martin and RB have been requested by the state and are pending. Also, please advise if you have Trayvon Martin's school records, if so, we would like a copy of them. We got the total station diagram and photos, but don’t have the location data captured by the software. Lastly, with regard to Trayvon Martin’s phone, there is a reference in the reports that Tracy Martin was asked to provide the password to his son’s phone so law enforcement could gain access to its contents and Mr.  Martin indicated to law enforcement that he wanted to speak with his attorney first. | can’t find a reference in the reports or in your interview with Mr.  Martin that that the issue was addressed.\n"

If George Zimmerman was not engaged in an unlawful activity and was attacked in any place where he had a right to be, he had no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he reasonably believed that it was necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.

On the other hand if, after carefully considering, comparing and weighing all the evidence, there is not an abiding conviction of guilt, or, if having a conviction, it is one which is not stable but one which wavers and vacillates, then the charge is not proved beyond every reasonable doubt and you must find George Zimmerman not guilty because the doubt is reasonable.

      "The inquiry is being conducted by agents of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement as well as investigators with the Office of the State Attorney. I’m gonna hand you a copy titled Narrative Report, Sanford Police Department and dated February 26, 2012. If you would please look that over and indicate if that is your handwriting, your signature and a statement that you provided to the Sanford Police Department. I believe it was the same weekend as the Daytona 500 and while we were watching TV, we kinda heard some loud noise outside, so we figured maybe it was just, you know, either kids in the neighborhood or people, you know, just havin’ a good time outside, and then we heard it again, so we muted the TV, but didn’t hear anything for a second. Um, and then we heard it like it was coming towards us, gettin’ a little louder, so I kept the TV on mute and went to go look outside, through the sliding glass door, through the blinds, and there’s only a porch light, so I couldn’t truly see what was out in the grass area and my fiancée, I, I’m pretty sure advised me not to open the door, but I had, I had to check, just to see what was going on. I’ve never heard a gunshot before, but now, knowing that was the gunshot that I heard, um, and from that point, as she was still making it up the stairs, I ran upstairs while I was on the phone with the uh, 9-1-1 person that answered my call, and I ran over to the window to look down, and when I looked down, I saw the person that was actually on top at that point, was laying in my grass, kind of in a sprawled position, not moving. Um, and then I saw the, ated pad with his hands in the air, as it looked, I don’t believe it was cops at that point. I think it was just ‘cause so many people had already dialed in, and the operator also told me that, you know, there was five other callers, calling in for the same thing that happened. pola Bectelor: OK.  And the person on top, as indicated in your statement today, dark colo Speaker 2: Not really ‘cause it, I mean it was just so dark, and if you see the back sidewalk at nighttime, if someone’s out there, you really have to look out there for the most part to even tell if it’s, you know, if it was, say you’re wearing a hat or a hoodie of some sort. John Bachelor: When you looked at this individual, and you wasn’t sure if he was making eye contact, did you, did you see, describe what you saw. Speaker 2: OK.  “Opened the door and saw a guy on the ground getting hit by another man on top of him in a straddling position. It’s, you know, I can’t see that close to where they were actually at, but he was still on top with both hands, uh, either tryin’ to hold the guy down or hitting him at that point. Please indicate your house, maybe _ something else that would be a landmark and then would you please, uh, show the first position that you described in your statement today and label it No. Um, and I run upstairs as fast as I can to see what happened from above instead of going right back to my door ‘cause I have no idea if there’s, you know, a gunfight or anything goin’ on in the backyard. John Bachelor: You mentioned earlier that the person on top when you went out to view was in a sprawled position not moving. Other Speaker: — the person on the bottom would’ve been some degree facing you, uh, I mean flat — It wasn’t an echo-y el, uh, help, bouncing off, you know, another house from the guy facing away from me. 044 Custom Pitenssa; wit_6 fdle_320_3 Dater 05/16/2032 Billed Word Count: 7373 - Speaker 1: Weare back on the record.

Sent Zenmeetoan: — the neighborhood has had a lot of crimes, um, my, my wife's, all our nei; rs get broken into and she got scared. George Zimmerman: Um, it was raining out and he was leisurely walking, taking his time, looking at all the houses. Um, the dispatcher, whoever answered the phone, asked me where they went and I said I wasn't sure because I lost visual of him when he went in between houses and, uh, he said, “Well, can you tell me what direction he went in,\" and I said, \"Not really. \" George Zimmerman: So, I was walking back through to where my car was and he jumped out from the bushes and he said, \"What the fuck's your problem, homey?\" Um, when he started doing that, I slid into the grass to try and get out from under him and so that he would stop hitting my head into the sidewalk and I'm still yelling for help. So, I just, uh, when I slid, my jacket and my shirt came up and when he said, \"You're gonna die tonight,\" I felt his hand go down on my side and I thought he was going for my firearm. Investigator Singleton: Does he fall to the side and he stays lying on the ground or does — George Zimmerman: I don't ****, I, my vision was blurry — So, I remember I, once I shot him, I holstered my firearm, and I got on top of him and I held him hands down 'cause he was still talking and he, and, uh, I said, \"Stay down. George Zimmerman: — where I lost sight of him at and when I walked back, that's when he came out of the darkness and I guess he was upset that I called the police so.\n"

      "COMES NOW the Defendant, GEORGE ZIMMERMAN, by and through his undersigned counsel, and files this response to the state’s motion to exclude self-serving hearsay statements of defendant and states the following: On May 10, 2013 the state filed a “generic” motion to exclude self-serving hearsay statements of the defendant. The motion did not identify any particular statements but it appeared that the state intended to prevent the defense from offering any of Mr.  Zimmerman’s many recorded statements to law enforcement, verbal statements to co-workers and friends at some remote time from the event where he explained the circumstances surrounding the shooting of Trayvon Martin in self-defense. At the hearing on the state’s motion on May 28, 2013, the defense agreed that Mr. Zimmerman’s exculpatory statements, remote in time, would not be admissible absent proper evidentiary predicate. However, in its motion the state also said \"Moreover, the statements would not be admissible as part of the res gestae in the instant case or under any recognized hearsay exception. \" The Court was advised that the defense wanted an opportunity to address the res gestae statements prior to the commencement of the trial. As the Court is aware, res gestae type statements made soon after an event are admissible notwithstanding that they are hearsay. Witness 13 and his wife heard a commotion in the back of their townhome. Within seconds of the shooting, W13 approached Mr.  Zimmerman who was staggering, bleeding and breathing hard. The witness observed blood on Mr.  Zimmerman’s face and the back of his head consistent with someone having been injured in a fight. Within a minute or so, Sanford Police Officer Tim Smith arrived on foot at the location where Mr.  Zimmerman and W13 were standing”. Officer Smith spoke with Mr.  Zimmerman at the scene upon his arrival. Mr.  Zimmerman acknowledged being the person who fired the shot and that he had a firearm on him. WHEREFORE, Mr.  Zimmerman respectfully requests this Honorable Court to deny the state’s motion in limine as to the res gestae statements of Mr.  Zimmerman. Both pictures were obtained by law enforcement and are evidence in the case. * Mr.  Zimmerman had called the police several minutes before and asked that an officer respond to the Retreat at Twin Lakes community. Officer Smith was en route at the time of the shot. | HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing has been furnished by U. S.  Mail/email/hand delivery this 21 day of June, 2013 to Bernie de la Rionda, Assistant State Attorney, John Guy, Assistant State Attorney, Office of the State Attorney, 220 East Bay Street, Jacksonville, Florida 32202-3429, and Mark M.  O’ Mara, O’ Mara Law Group, 1416 E. Concord St. , Orlando, FL 32803.\n"

Corey, who was assigned this case under Executive Order of the Governor 12-72. Your Affiants, along with other law enforcement officials have taken sworn statements from witnesses, spoken with law enforcement officers who have provided sworn testimony in reports, reviewed other reports, recorded statements, phone records, recorded calls to police, photographs, videos, and other documents in detailing the following: walked to a nearby 7-11 store where he purchased a can of iced tea and a bag of Zimmerman felt Martin did not belong in the gated community and called the police. During the recorded call Zimmerman made reference to people he felt had committed and gotten away with break-ins in his neighborhood. The witness advised that Martin was scared because he was being followed through the complex by an unknown male and didn’t know why. Martin attempted to run home but was followed by Zimmerman who didn’t want the person he falsely assumed was going to commit a crime to get away before the police arrived. Zimmerman disregarded the police dispatcher and continued to follow Martin who was trying to return to his home. Assistant Medical Examiner Dr.  Bao performed an autopsy and determined that Martin died from the gunshot wound.\n"
