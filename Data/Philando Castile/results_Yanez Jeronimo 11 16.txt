STATEMENT OF PROBABLE CAUSE
The Complainant states that the following facts establish probable cause:

Your complainant is Doug Henning, Special Agent, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, He states
that the following is true, correct, and establishes probable cause:

On July 2, 2016, a Super USA convenience store in Lauderdale, Minnesota, was robbed by two black males.
Video surveillance of that robbery showed two black male suspects, both with dreadlocks, glasses, baseball hats
and firearms, Saint Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez was one of the responding officers to the robbery.

On July 6, 2016, just after 9:00 P.M., Yanez, was on patrol when he noticed a vehicle being driven by Philando
Dival Castile, a 32-year-old black male with dreadlocks who wore glasses, and was driving eastbound on
Larpenteur Avenuc in Lauderdale near the scene of the unsolved Super U.S.A, robbery, Accompanying Castile
in the vehicle was his girlfriend Diamond Reynolds seated in the front passenger seat, and Reynold’s 4-year-old
daughter, DIR, seated in a child seat in the right side rear passenger seat,

Yanez communicated his intent to pull over Castile’s vehicle by radio to Saint Anthony Police Officer Joseph
Kauser who was on patrol nearby. Yanez told Kauser that he had reason to pull the vehicle over and that the
occupants “just look like the people that were involved in a robbery.” Yanez, further stated that “the driver looks
more like one of our suspects just because of the wide sel nose.” Yanez noted that he also had reason to stop the
vehicle because it had a non-working brake light. Yanez followed Castile’s vehicle, waiting until Kauser
arrived as back-up,

At 9:02:05 P.M., Yanez queried Castile’s license plate number, ‘The query results showed that the vehicle was
registered to Castile, it was not listed as stolen, and there were no warrants for his arrest. Yanez did not notify
dispatchers that he was conducting the stop or that he suspected that a robbery suspect was in the vehicle, AL
9:04:48 P.M., Yanez activated his squad lights signaling Castile to pull over. Castile complied by immediately
pulling over on the eastbound side of Larpenteur Avenue, near Fry Street in Falcon Heights, Ramsey County,
Minnesota. ’

Approximately one minute later, Yanez shot Castile seven times, killing him, The following is a summary of the
events immediately preceding the shooting, based on squad car audio and video recordings of the stop:
9:05:00 P.M. - Castile’s vehicle came to a complete stop next to the curb.
toward the vehicle, Yanez had his right hand on the right side of his duty belt near his gun, Castile
was buckled in his seatbelt.
window, exchanged greetings with Castile, and informed Castile of the brake light problem.
9:05:33 P.M, - Kauser approached on the sidewalk on the passenger side of Castile’s vehicle, and
stopped near the rear seat passenger door.
9:05:38 P.M, - Yanez asked for Castile’s driver’s license and proof of insurance.
9:05:48 P.M, - Castile provided Yanez with his proof of insurance card,
9:05:49 P.M.-9:05:
the card in his outer pocket. ;
9:05:52 P,M.-9:05:55 P.M, - Castile calmly informed Yanez: “Sir, [ have to tell you that Ido have a
firearm on me.” Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied
“Okay” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered gun,
Jeronimo Yanez Page: 4 of 10
Co. Atty Complaint No: 0620373879

9:05:55 _P.M.--9:06:02 P.M. - Yanez said “Okay, don’t reach for it, then.” Castile responded:
“U?m,..?m,,, [inaudible] reaching. ..,” before being again interrupted by Yanez, who said “Don’t pull
it out.” Castile responded “I’m not pulling it out”, and Reynolds also said “He’s not pulling it out,”
Yanez screamed “Don’t pull it out” and quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand while he
reached inside the driver’s side window with his left hand. Yanez removed his left arm from the car,
then fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession, The seventh shot was fired at
9:06:02 P.M, During the incident, Kauser did not touch or remove his gun.

9:06:03 P.M.-9:06:04 P.M. - Reynolds yelled “You just killed my boyfiiend!”

9:06:04 P.M.-9:06:05 P.M. - Castile moaned and said “I wasn’t reaching for it.”

9:06:05 P,M.—9:06:09 P.M, - Reynolds loudly said “He wasn’t reaching for it.” Before she completed her
sentence, Yanez again screamed “Don’t pull it out!” Reynolds responded “He wasn’t.” Yanez yelled
‘Don’t move! Fuck!”

Audio and video was also livestreamed by Reynolds on Facebook immediately after the shooting and while Yanez
had his gun drawn and pointed toward the mortally wounded Castile. In the audio recorded by this livestream
starting at 9:06:42 P.M., Reynolds stated that Castile “.,. was trying to get out his [D in his wallet out his um
pocket and he let the officer know that he was, reach he had a firearm and he was reaching for his wallet and the
officer just shot him in his arm,” The following interchange between Yanez and Reynolds was also recorded:
Reynolds: “Stay with me, We got pulled over for a busted tail light in the back. And the police just
he’s, he’s, he’s covered. He, they just killed my boyfriend,”
Yanez: “Fuck”
Reynolds: “He’s licensed. He’s carried, he is licensed to carry.”
Yanez: “Ma’am just keep your hands where they are.”
Reynolds: “I will sir. No worries. 1 will.”
Yanez: “Fuck!”
Reynolds: “He just shot his arm off. We got pulled over...”
Yanez: “fuck”
Reynolds: “...on Larpenteur.”
Yanez: “I told him not to reach for it, T told him to get his hand off of it.”
Reynolds: “He had, you told him to get his 1D sir and his driver’s license, Oh my God please don’t tell
me he’s dead.”

Assisting officers arrived, unbuckled Castile’s seatbelt, and removed Castile from the vehicle. They performed
CPR on Castile until paramedics arrived and took over, When officers and paramedics rolled Castile to his right
side so that a backboard could be put under him, they saw and removed a .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun
fram inside the large right front pocket of Castile’s shorts (measuring approximately 12” deep x 6” wide), The
gun contained a loaded magazine but did not have a round in the chamber. Castile was transported to Hennepin
County Medical Center (HCMC). In the HCMC emergency department, medical personnel recovered a holster
and wallet from one of Castile’s pockets, although it was unclear which pocket these items were in at the time
of the shooting, In Castile’s wallet was his Minnesota Driver’s License and his Permit to Carry a Pistol,

Within minutes after the shooting, Yanez spoke with Saint Anthony Police Officer Tressa Sunde

at the scene of the shooting. During that conversation, which was captured on Yanez’s squad microphone and

recorded at 9:13:00 P.M., Yanez, said:
“tHe [Castile] was sitting in the car, seat belted. I told him, can [ see your license, And then, he told me
he had a firearm. I told him not fo reach for it and (sigh) when he went down to grab, I told him not to
reach for it (clears throat) and then he kept it right there, and I told him to take his hands off of it, and
then he (sigh) he had his, his grip a lot wider than a wallet.”

Yanez went on to say:
“And I don’t know where the gun was, he didn’t tell me where the fucking gun was and then it was just
getting hinky, he gave, he was just staring straight ahead, and the I was getting fucking nervous, and
then I told him, I know I fucking told him to get his fucking hand off his gun.”

Yanez was interviewed by BCA investigators the following day on July 7 at 1:42 P.M. During that interview
Yanez said that when he first approached Castile’s driver’s side window he smelled burnt marijuana coming
from inside the vehicle. Yanez said he also noticed a female child in the back seat and an adult female in the
front passenger seat, Yanez described Castile as initially having “his left arm over the steering wheel” with
“both hands in view.”

Yanez said he did not mention anything about the marijuana smell to Castile so as not to “scare

{Castile} or have him react in a defensive manner.” Yanez said that Castile “kept his, hands in view” up until the
point at which he asked for Castile’s license and insurance. After receipt of his proof of insurance, Yanez said
Castile lold him that he had a firearm at the same time that “he reached” down between his right leg, his right
thigh area and the center console.” Yanez said that, as Castile was reaching down to his right, “he turned his
shoulder, kept his left hand on the sleering wheel and then canted his upper body and blocked my view of his
right hand,”

Yanez said:
“And, at that point I, was scared and I was, in fear for my life and my partner’s life, And for the little
girl in the back and the front seat passenger and he dropped his hand down and, can’t remember what I
was telling him but I was telling something as his hand went down I think, And, he put his hand around
something. And his hand made like a C shape type um type shape and it appeared to me that he was
wrapping something around his fingers and almost like if T were to put my uh hand around my gun like
putting my hand up to the butt of the gun,’ ...

And then I lost view of it. Cuz he kept canting his shoulder and then I believe I told him again I can’t
remember don’t do it. And then he still kept moving his hand and at this point I looked and saw
something in his hand. It was dark inside the vehicle. T was trying to fumble my way through under
stress to look and see what il was to make sure uh what I was secing. But I wasn’t given enough time
and like I said he had no regard for what I was saying. Didn’t follow my direction. And, ub he started
reaching out and then pulling uh away from his uh his right thigh, I don’t know if it was in his pocket or
in between the seats or the center console. Bul 1, 1 know he had an object and it was dark, And he was
pulling it out with his right hand, And as he was pulling it out I, a million things started going through
my head, And I thought I was gonna dic, And, | was scared because, I didn’t know if he was gonna, I
didn’t know what he was gonna do. He just had somethin’ uh his hands and he, the first words that he
said to me were, some of the first words he said is that he had a gun. And I thought he was reaching for
the gun. I thought he had the gun in his hand, in his right hand. And I thought he had it enough to where
all he had to do is just pull it out, point it at me, move his trigger finger down on the trigger and let off
rounds, And I had no other option than, to take out my firearm and, and J shot, Um I shot him, I don’t
remember the first couple shots, I, believe T remember the last two shots, And I believe one of the shots
went into his left arm. Um, as I was shooting uh 1, [ kept watching him, And.I, I remember smelling the
gun smoke and the bright flashes from the muzzle, And then I heard, a couple pops uh from my firearm,
Um and then my partner was on the opposite side of the vehicle. Uh watch, Jooking in and I directed ny
gunfire down as best as [ could, Away from, not trying to put the little girl’s life al jeopardy or the
passenger or my partner because they were, in the line of my fire.”

Kauser was interviewed by BCA investigators at 1:10 AM on July 7. During that interview,

Kauser said the following:
“Um I couldn’t hear the conversation going on inside the vehicle. I could hear what my partner was
saying, And, I, I don’t remember the entire conversation. I know my partner said don’t reach for it. And
the passenger kinda leaned on his right butt check and he put his hand on his right hip. 1 don’t know if
he was reaching for a firearm or wallet. 1, I couldn’t sec. I just saw that he had his right hand on his hip,
Like I said my partner said don’t reach for it. And then there were shots fired.”

Kauser also said that he did not sce Yanez’ gun until he began shooting, Yanez gave no warning to Kauser that
Castile had a gun. When asked if he was surprised when Yanez began shooting, Kauser replied “absolutely.”

An autopsy concluded that Castile died of exsanguination duc to multiple gunshot wounds. Toxicology testing
showed that Castile was positive for THC at the time of this death. A bullet fired by Yanez passed through the
driver's seat and struck the rear seat on the driver’s side, Diamond Reynold’s child, in her car seat, was on the
passenger side of the rear seat. Another bullet fired by Yanez struck the armrest between Castile and Reynolds,

The robbery of the Super USA in Lauderdale remains unsolved, but subsequent investigation has ruled out
Castile as a suspect in that robbery, Video of'a robbery, committed in Blaine after the time of Castile’s death,
shows a suspect whose physical features resemble the suspect from the Lauderdale robbery, and displaying a
gun (hat appears to be the same gun as the one used in the Lauderdale robbery, The gun used in the Lauderdale
and Blaine robberies also appears to be different than Castile’s gun,

According to Jeffrey J, Noble, an expert on police procedure retained by the Ramsey County Attorncy’s Office,
the totality of the circumstances indicate that Yanez’ use of deadly force against Castile during the July 6 stop
was not necessary, was objectively unreasonable and was inconsistent with generally accepted police practices.

In addition, under the same circumstances, Yanez’s discharge of his firearm seven times into a vehicle in very
close proximity to and towards Reynolds and her four-year-old daughter endangered their safety.
