Ramsey County Attorney announces criminal charges against
police officer in death of Philando Castile
Officer Jeronimo Yanez to make first court appearance Friday afternoon

Saint Paul, Minnesota - The Ramsey County Attorney’s Office (RCAO) today charged St.
Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez with Second Degree Manslaughter in the death of
Philando Castile and two additional felony counts of Intentional Discharge of a Dangerous
Weapon that endangered the safety of Diamond Reynolds and her four-year-old daughter in
connection with a July 6, 2016, traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. Yanez will make his
first appearance at 1:30 p.m. Friday in Ramsey County District Court at the Ramsey County Law
Enforcement Center, 425 Grove Street in St. Paul.

“Based upon our thorough and exhaustive review of the facts, I have come to the conclusion that
there simply was no justification for the use of deadly force by Officer Yanez in this case. No
reasonable officer who knew, saw, and heard what Officer Yanez did at the time would have
used deadly force under these circumstances,” said Ramsey County Attorney John Choi.

“T ask for the public’s continued patience, trust and respect for the integrity of the process as we
prosecute this case and seek justice for Philando Castile, his family and friends, including
Diamond Reynolds and her daughter, and our broader community.”

The attached criminal complaint goes into detail about the events that transpired that day, as
revealed by the investigation to-date. Please visit RCAO News & Updates page for complete
information.

It should be noted that a criminal complaint is merely an accusation and that a defendant is
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.
