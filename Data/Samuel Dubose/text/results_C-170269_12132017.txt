OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

Mock, Presiding Judge.

{41} On July 19, 2015, University of Cincinnati Police Officer Raymond
Tensing initiated a traffic stop of Samuel DuBose. During the course of the
encounter, Tensing discharged his firearm, killing DuBose. Ten days later, a
Hamilton County grand jury issued a two-count indictment, charging Tensing with
murder and voluntary manslaughter. Amid significant local, national, and global
media coverage, the case proceeded to trial beginning on October 31, 2016. The trial
proceeded to jury deliberation until, on November 12, the jury announced it was
hopelessly deadlocked and the trial judge declared a mistrial.

{42} On December 7, 2016, the case was transferred to Respondent Leslie
E. Ghiz (“Respondent”), Judge of the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas for a
second trial. Prior to the trial commencing, Respondent put on an entry which
limited media coverage of the proceedings. Respondent also refused to release the
questionnaires that had been completed by prospective jurors in the case. As a result
of that entry, several media outlets filed complaints in this court seeking a writ of
prohibition to prevent Respondent from enforcing the restrictions. This court
granted an alternate writ, preventing Respondent from enforcing the order, holding
that “[iJn the absence of an evidentiary hearing and particularized findings, the
restrictions imposed by the Respondent are contrary to law.” In light of this court’s
ruling, Respondent vacated her original order. This court then dismissed the
petitions as moot.

{43} Pursuant to the mandate from this court, Respondent conducted a
hearing on the matter on June 1, 2017. During the hearing, Respondent heard
testimony from three individuals. The first individual had been the courtroom bailiff

during the first Tensing trial. He testified to the contents of an affidavit he had
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

prepared in which he averred that some of the jurors during the first trial had
expressed discomfort at being publically identified as jurors. A deputy testified that
she had observed, on courthouse surveillance video, two individuals who appeared to
be photographing individuals outside the main entrance of the courthouse on the
first day of jury selection. Another deputy testified about the security measures
taken during the first Tensing trial, including the restrictions put in place for the use
of electronic devices in the area around the courtroom. Respondent also reviewed
the completed juror questionnaires. Of the 180 completed forms, the court found
that 38 individuals had said that they would not be willing to serve if their identities
became known publically, and 39 individuals said they would be “concerned about
their personal safety, reputation or standing in their community among family,
friends and associates” should they be asked to serve on the jury.

{44} | Respondent also took judicial notice of other matters. For example,
she took judicial notice of the fact that she had presided over another criminal trial in
which an associate of that defendant had used social media to try and locate jurors.
She also took judicial notice of two separate instances involving cellular devices in
pretrial hearings: one in which a prospective juror’s phone rang during a proceeding
because he or she had forgotten to silence it, and another in which a spectator had
dropped a phone during a hearing while testimony was being taken, “causing a
distraction.” She also took “judicial notice” that “certain interactions between police
officers and African American citizens wherein deadly force was used or death
otherwise resulted have found their way into criminal courtrooms and some judicial
outcomes have led to massive public outcry and even serious violence against
persons,” but she determined that she “need not list or detail [the] incidents seen in

America over the last few years.”
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

{95} As a result of the hearings, and the other information of which she
had taken judicial notice, Respondent issued two separate decisions on court and
information access. First, she signed an entry in which she denied the request for
release of the questionnaires completed by the serving and prospective jurors until
after the trial had concluded. Upon the conclusion of the trial, Respondent indicated
that the questionnaires would be released, with personally-identifying information
redacted.

{§6} | Respondent later issued a separate decision in which she severely
restricted media access to the proceedings. The restrictions included limiting access
to the courtroom to four randomly selected members of the media—regardless of the
amount of seating that would otherwise be available to the general public; forbidding
the use of electronic devices in the courtroom by anyone other than attorneys or
court personnel; forbidding the use of electronic devices on the fifth floor of the
courthouse (the floor on which the trial was proceeding) except by attorneys, court
personnel, or media representatives in a specifically-designated media room;
forbidding photographing or video recording of jurors or prospective jurors; and
limiting media to using a single, shared camera with a video and audio feed that
would be available for the use of all, would be broadcast to the media room and
would be available for livestreaming on the internet or recording for later use.

{47} Relators filed complaints with this court, petitioning the court for
writs of prohibition and mandamus. Relators seek a writ of mandamus to compel
Respondent to release the unredacted jury questionnaires. They seek a writ of
prohibition prohibiting her from enforcing the restrictions put in place on the

media’s access to the trial proceedings. After the initial pleadings were submitted,
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

Relators filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming they are entitled to relief as

a matter of law.
The Writ of Mandamus

{48} To be entitled to a writ of mandamus, a relator must establish (1) a
clear legal right to the relief sought, (2) a clear legal duty on the part of the
respondent to perform the requested act, and (3) the lack of an adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law. State ex rel. Scott v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections, 139
Ohio St.3d 171, 2014-Ohio-1685, 10 N.E.3d 697, { 14. These requirements must be
proved by clear and convincing evidence. Id. “Mandamus is the appropriate vehicle
to compel disclosure of specific records requested under the Ohio Public Records Act
and the Ohio and United States Constitutions.” State ex rel. Beacon Journal
Publishing Co. v. Bond, 98 Ohio St.3d 146, 2002-Ohio-7117, 781 N.E.2d 180, {1 50,
citing State ex rel. News Herald v. Ottawa Cty. Court of Common Pleas, 77 Ohio
St.3d 40, 45, 671 N.E.2d 5 (1996).

{49} The right to access completed juror questionnaires arises from the
Free Speech and Free Press Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, together with the analogous provision of Article I, Section 11 of the
Ohio Constitution and the “open courts” provision of Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio
Constitution. See Bond at 19. The public has a presumptive right to access during
voir dire proceedings. Bond at {| 18, citing Press-Ent. Co. v. Superior Court of
California for Riverside Cty., 464 U.S. 501, 508-510, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629
(1984). This same presumption of access applies to the answers given to written
questions, because “[t]he fact that the questioning of jurors was largely done in

written form rather than orally is of no constitutional import.” Bond at 4 19, quoting
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court, 228 Cal.App.3d 77, 89, 278 Cal.Rptr. 443
(1991). As the Bond court noted:

the purpose behind juror questionnaires is merely to expedite the

examination of prospective jurors, it follows that such questionnaires

are part of the voir dire process. The fact that a lawyer elicits juror

responses from written questions rather than oral questions has no

bearing on whether the responses are considered in accepting or
rejecting a juror.
Bond at 418.

{410} But the right of access to the voir dire proceedings is not absolute.
The First Amendment right creating a presumption of openness may be overcome
“by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve
higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.” Bond at {| 17, quoting
Press-Ent., 464 U.S. at 508, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629. Additionally, identifying
information such as Social Security numbers, telephone numbers, and driver’s
license numbers should be redacted because they are not properly part of the voir
dire process. Bond at 4 25.

{F11} At its core, the problem in this case is that Respondent failed to
conduct an inquiry on the issue in accordance with the procedure outlined in Bond.
The court instructed trial judges to “inform prospective jurors of their right to
request an in-camera hearing, on the record and with counsel present, regarding any
written question during the voir dire process.” Bond, 98 Ohio St.3d 146, 2002-Ohio-
7117, 781 N.E.2d 180, at {| 22, citing Press-Ent., 464 U.S. at 513, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78
L.Ed.2d 629. If an individual juror has a concern about the disclosure of information

on the form, the trial judge should then “make a determination on the record as to
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

whether a prospective juror has a legitimate privacy interest to warrant the
nondisclosure of a response.” Jd. This individual questioning could begin with the
12 jurors selected as the prospective jury before the parties commence their
challenges, and could be guided by the jurors’ responses in the questionnaires. The
Bond court concluded that “[i]f the trial judge finds a valid basis for nondisclosure,
the judge should notify the prospective juror of his or her right to refrain from
answering the question on the questionnaire form and should seal the hearing
transcript.”

{412} Respondent did not inquire of the individual jurors about their ability
or willingness to serve if the questionnaire information was released to the public.
She did not even voir dire those who indicated that it would. Had this occurred, the
trial court would have had several options available, including, but not limited to,
redacting information on individual questionnaires, redacting certain information on
all questionnaires, withholding disclosure of the questionnaires until the conclusion
of the trial, and excusing for cause jurors who were so sensitive to their service
becoming known that they could not serve effectively. The Bond court recognized
that each case would provide its own challenges, stating that “we defer to trial courts
to establish the manner in which prospective jurors may request an in-camera
hearing when completing juror questionnaires.” Bond at { 24. But some form of
individual engagement with the jurors must occur to create a record sufficient to
justify withholding information from the public.

{413} And the failure to engage in this inquiry has significantly limited the
value of the evidence that is present in the record. For example, Respondent noted
that there were 38 responses indicating an unwillingness to serve if identities became

known publically, and 39 responses indicating concern about “personal safety,
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

reputation or standing in their community among family, friends and associates.” 22
of the respondents answered “yes” to both questions. But we have no information
from the individual jurors to flesh out the bases for their concerns. And while
Respondent made several observations about what had occurred in the previous
litigation of the Tensing charges, in other cases over which she had presided, and in
other cases involving the use of deadly force by law enforcement across the nation,
the lack of a voir dire significantly limited evidence connecting this information to
these jurors and this case.

{414} On this record, Respondent made insufficient findings to support her
decision to withhold the completed juror questionnaires in their entirety from public
disclosure. In fact, the findings she made only addressed the nondisclosure of
identifying information, including the names and addresses of the jurors. Therefore,
Relators have clearly met their burden to demonstrate that they are entitled to the
release of information other than identifying information.

{415} The issue that remains for us to decide is whether juror-identifying
information must also be disclosed. First, we note that the Bond court specifically
held that Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and telephone numbers
should be redacted. But the court considered the issue of disclosing names and
addresses separately. See Bond, 98 Ohio St.3d 146, 2002-Ohio-7117, 781 N.E.2d 180,
at (34-47. The court concluded that “the First Amendment qualified right to access
extends to juror names and addresses.” (Emphasis added.) Id. Such a qualified right
creates a “presumption of openness” requiring disclosure—a presumption that can
only be overcome with a demonstration of “an overriding interest based on findings

that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

that interest.” Bond at 159, quoting Press-Ent., 464 U.S. at 510, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78
L.Ed.2d 629.

{416} In Bond, the court concluded that the names and addresses should
have been disclosed. But the court made that determination because “the trial court
failed to articulate particularized findings [necessitating] the total suppression of
juror names and addresses.” Bond at 159. In this case, we conclude that Relators
demonstrated that they had a qualified right to access the information that created a
presumption of openness, but Respondent’s findings were sufficient to overcome
that presumption. The trial court made findings that support the conclusion that
there may be a risk to the jurors in the case that exceeds the risk borne generally by
jurors who serve in criminal trials, and those findings were sufficient to rebut the
presumption of openness as to the jurors’ names and addresses.

{417} Along with names and addresses, and for the same reason, we further
conclude that the redaction of the identity of a juror’s current employer is
appropriate in cases where the juror is self-employed or works for a company or
organization that is so small that the release of the name of the employer would be
tantamount to identifying the juror.

{418} Concededly this is a close case. It was perhaps made needlessly close
by the fact that Respondent failed to conduct a proper and complete Bond hearing in
accordance with our prior order. But we conclude that the findings made by the trial
court were sufficient, if only barely. Respondent should have released the redacted
questionnaires immediately after conducting the hearing on the issue and before the
trial commenced. For these reasons, we issue a limited writ of mandamus
compelling Respondent to release the completed questionnaires after first redacting

personal identifying information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers,

10
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

telephone numbers, driver’s license numbers, and current employers if listing the

employer would be tantamount to identifying the individual juror.
Writ of Prohibition

{19} Relators also seek a writ of prohibition to compel the trial court to
rescind its restrictions on courtroom access. A writ of prohibition is a preventive
measure that “is designed to prevent a tribunal from proceeding in a matter which it
is not authorized to hear and determine.” State ex rel. Stefanick v. Marietta Mun.
Court, 21 Ohio St.2d 102, 104, 255 N.E.2d 634 (1970); see State ex rel. Jones v.
Suster, 84 Ohio St.3d 70, 73, 701 N.E.2d 1002 (1998). To prevail in this case,
Relators must establish that (1) the trial court is about to exercise judicial power, (2)
the exercise of that power is unauthorized by law, and (3) denying the writ will result
in injury for which no other adequate remedy at law exists. State ex rel. Douglas v.
Burlew, 106 Ohio St.3d 180, 2005-Ohio-4382, 833 N.E.2d 293, 4 9; State ex rel.
White v. Junkin, 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 336, 686 N.E.2d 267 (1997).

{420} We conclude that the petition is moot. The trial has concluded, the
indictments have been dismissed, and the applicable restrictions are no longer in
place. The dissent would have this court address this issue by invoking the seldom-
used authority to decide questions that are “capable of repetition, yet evading
review.” While the question involves conduct that is too short in duration to be fully
litigated prior to its cessation, we do not have a reasonable expectation that the same
complaining party will be subjected to the same action again. See State ex rel.
Cincinnati Enquirer v. Ronan, 124 Ohio St.3d 17, 2009-Ohio-5947, 918 N.E.2d 515, 9
5, citing State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington, 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729
N.E.2d 1182 (2000). The case over which Respondent presided was singular in

terms of its subject matter and media attention. The possibility of a case of this

11
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

nature and magnitude is far too unlikely to recur for this court to pursue this

extraordinary exercise of jurisdiction.
Conclusion

{21} We issue a limited writ of mandamus to compel the trial court to
release the completed juror questionnaires of all 180 potential jurors after redacting
identifying information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers,
telephone numbers, driver’s license numbers, and places of employment where
appropriate. We dismiss the petition for the writ of prohibition as moot.

Judgment accordingly.

DETERS, J., concurs.
ZAYAS, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.

ZAYAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.

{422} I concur with the majority’s holding regarding the petition for a writ
of mandamus. However, I respectfully dissent from the majority's conclusion that
the petition for a writ of prohibition is moot. While the cause is technically moot,
there is a recognized exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are “capable
of repetition, yet evading review,” and it is within our authority to raise the
applicability of this exception sua sponte. See State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v.
Bronson, 191 Ohio App.3d 160, 2010-Ohio-5315, 945 N.E.2d 551, 9.8 (12th Dist.). To
meet this exception, the following conditions must apply: “(1) the challenged action
is too short in duration to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration and (2)
there is ‘a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected

to the same action again.’ ” Paige v. Ohio High School Athletic Assn., 2013-Ohio-

12
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

4713, 999 N.E.2d 1211, § 17 (ist Dist.), quoting State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper
Arlington, 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729 N.E.2d 1182 (2000).

{923} The first element is met here because a criminal trial’s duration is
almost always much shorter than this court’s typical period of review. See Press-Ent.
Co. v. Superior Court of California for Riverside Cty., 478 U.S. 1, 6, 106 S.Ct. 2735,
92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (“It can reasonably be assumed that * * *, because criminal
proceedings are typically of short duration, such an order will likely evade review.”);
State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Louden, 91 Ohio St.3d 61, 64, 741 N.E.2d 517
(2001) (“[A] closure order usually expires before an appellate court can consider
it[.]”); State ex rel. Dispatch Printing v. Geer, 114 Ohio St.3d 511, 2007-Ohio-4643,
873 N.E.2d 314, 7 11 (noting that an order prohibiting a newspaper from taking
photographs of a juvenile’s face during a plea hearing was, “[l]ike more typical
orders[,] * * * too brief in its duration to be fully litigated before the plea hearing
concluded.”); State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Ohio Dept. of Pub. Safety, 148
Ohio St.3d 433, 2016-Ohio-7987, 71 N.E.3d 258, 1 30 (noting that the “short
duration of * * * criminal proceedings”—less than two months between the suspect’s
arrest and guilty plea—“truncated the Enquirer’s ability to fully litigate its mandamus
claim before us”).

{24} In the case at hand, it was a mere three weeks between the beginning
of voir dire and the trial’s end.

{25} The second element is met because essentially every media company
in Cincinnati is a petitioner in this case, and there is a “reasonable expectation” that
a trial court will issue a substantially similar order restricting the activities of these
media companies in a future high-profile criminal trial. See Bronson at | 3-4, 7-8

(holding that there was “a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party

13
OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS

will be subject to the same action again” where the judge had restricted a
newspaper's access to the jury view of the crime scene in a high-profile murder trial);
Ohio Dept. of Public Safety at { 31 (holding that case was not moot because,
“[w]ithout resolution of the questions at issue here, we can reasonably expect the
Enquirer and other media outlets to continue to request dash-cam recordings and
law-enforcement agencies to continue to withhold them.”); Press-Ent., 478 U.S. at 6,
106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (holding that case was not moot because “[i]t can
reasonably be assumed that petitioner will be subjected to a similar closure order.”).

{26} For example, part of the relief sought in WCPO’s petition was a writ
prohibiting respondent from “forbidding WCPO from broadcasting, televising,
photographing, or recording jurors or prospective jurors.” Since the “filming, video-
taping, recording or taking photographs of jurors” is prohibited “in any
circumstance” by Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas Rule 30(F), there is, at
the very least, a “reasonable expectation” that WCPO would again be prohibited from
“broadcasting, televising, photographing, or recording jurors.” See, e.g., Geer, 114
Ohio St.3d 511, 2007-Ohio-4643, 873 N.E.2d 314, at 4 12 (finding a “reasonable
expectation that the judge will subject the Dispatch to comparable orders in the
future” where the judge “maintain[ed] that his order ‘was specifically authorized’ by
Sup.R. 12.”).

{27} Therefore, the exception to the mootness doctrine should be applied
here, and this court should proceed to rule on the merits of the petition for a writ of

prohibition because the issues are “capable of repetition, yet evading revew.”

Please note:
The court has recorded its own entry on the date of the release of this opinion.
