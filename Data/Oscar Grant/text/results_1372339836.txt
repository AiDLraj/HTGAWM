AOC# 1009606-10
Alameda County Superior Court Case #161210

DEFENDANT JOHANNES MEHSERLE’S MOTIONS
IN LIMINE

Defendant Johannes Mehserle hereby in limine as follows:

1. To REQUIRE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND PROSECUTION WITNESSES TO REFER TO
OSCAR GRANT BY NAME, RATHER THAN REFERRING TO HIM AS THE VICTIM

The prosecution no doubt believes that Oscar Grant is the victim of a crime. In fact, until

twelve jurors convict defendant Mehserle of a crime, such references by the prosecution or its

witnesses would be unnecessarily argumentative, distracting, and inaccurate. For that reason the

Court should insist that the DA and its witnesses refer to Mr. Grant by name.

In the event the Court denies the motion, defendant reserves the right, and there should be

no objection, to the defense referring to Mr. Grant as the suspect or the arrestee. In fact, such

references are more literally accurate than referring to Grant as the victim, which assumes a crime

has been committed.

2. To REQUIRE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND PROSECUTION WITNESSES TO REFER TO
DEFENDANT MEHSERLE AS OFFICER MEHSERLE

At the time of all relevant events in this case, Johannes Mehserle was not a defendant, he
was not a suspect—-he was a BART police officer. The parties and witnesses therefore should be
required to refer to. the defendant as Officer Mehserle during this trial.

Doing so will have one important benefit unrelated to accuracy. Elsewhere Mehserle will
argue that for various reasons relating to Mehserle’s Fifth Amendment rights, evidence relating to
employment actions taken against Mehserle should be excluded, By requiring that the parties
refer to the defendant as Officer Mehserle, the Court will avoid any speculation by jurors
regarding Mehserle’s refusal to provide a statement to BART investigators, employment actions
taken against Mehserle as a result of that decision or for any other reason, and the significance of
such employment actions.

3. To REQUIRE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO ADMONISH His WITNESSES NOT TO
REFER TO THE GRANT SHOOTING AS A MURDER

In the days and weeks following Oscar Grant’s death, members of the media, community
leaders, religious leaders, and local, state, and national politicians, referred to the event as a
murder, and in some cases ani execution. Strictly speaking, of course, murder is an abstraction—a
label we use to describe a particular confluence of act and mental state as to which the legislature
has imposed a particular prison sentence. In fact, a homicide does not become properly
classifiable as a murder until twelve jurors agree that the prosecution has satisfied the elements of
Penal Code §187 beyond a reasonable doubt.

In this case the use of the word murder to describe the event is particularly prejudicial
where the defendant is a police officer who shot a resisting suspect, But various individuals who
will likely appear as prosecution witnesses have used the word—in interviews, at the preliminary
hearing—to describe the events of January 1, 2009. Mehserle therefore seeks an order of this
Court directing the District Attorney to admonish its witnesses, both lay and expert, not to use the
word in their testimony.

4, To PRECLUDE SPECTATORS FROM WEARING BUTTONS, RIBBONS, OR ANY OTHER
SIGNS OF PARTISANSHIP DURING THE TRIAL

As the Court is aware, the Grant shooting and the resulting prosecution have garnered
massive and unprecedented community and media attention. As a result of that attention, and of
violence that arose in Alameda County after the shooting, the matter was transferred to this Court.
But given that demonstrations by groups and other supporters of Oscar Grant in favor of
Mehserle’s conviction have persisted, and will no doubt intensify during the trial, there is the real
risk that jurors could be unduly influenced. In an effort to avoid such an invalid impact on
Mehserle’s right to a fair and impartial jury, a weakening of the presumption of innocence, and
potential interference with the defendant’s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights, the defendant
moves the Court to-preclude spectators seated in the gallery from wearing buttons, ribbons, or any
other signs that suggest they support either the prosecution or the defense.

There can be no doubt that the Court has the power to control its courtroom and thus to

impose such a restriction, See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia (1980) 448 U.S. 555, 564

(recognizing superiority of defendant's right to a fair trial over first amendment rights of

nonparticipants). Because the presumption that a defendant is innocent until proved guilty is a
“basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice,” “courts must be alert to
factors that may undermine the fairness of the fact-finding process” and “must carefully guard
against dilution of the principle that guilt is to be established by probative evidence and beyond a
reasonable doubt.” Estelle v. Williams (1976) 425 U.S. 501, 503.

Courts have long recognized two problems that arise when spectators with an obvious view
that the defendant should be convicted are permitted to display signs of that view in the presence
of the jurors. First, such a practice undermines the presumption of innocence. See, e.g., Norris v.
Risley (9" Cir. 1990) 918 F.2d $28, 831 (buttons worn by women attending a rape trial
“constituted a continuing reminder that various spectators believed the.defendant’s guilt before it
was proven, eroding the presumption of innocence.”’)

Second, the display of such signs impacts a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right of

confrontation. See Norris, 918 F.2d at 833 (“failing to exclude the buttons interfered with the

defendant’s constitutional right to be accused from the ‘witness stand in a public courtroom
where there is full judicial protection’ of the rights of confrontation and cross-examination’”),
quoting Turner v. Louisiana (1965) 379 U.S. 466, 472-73.

Defendant looks forward to a fair public trial before twelve unbiased jurors. He believes
that an important means of ensuring such a fair trial and avoiding the undue influence of
spectators on the jury is for the Court to insist that those observing the proceedings keep their
views to themselves.

5. To ADMIT EVIDENCE OF PRIOR MISCONDUCT BY OSCAR GRANT, GRANT’S

PROBATIONARY STATUS IN 2007, HIS PAROLE STATUS AT THE TIME OF THE 2009

SHOOTING, AND THE FACT THAT GRANT HAD BEEN DRINKING IN THE HOURS PRIOR
TO THE SHOOTING

Defendant anticipates. that the DA will move to exclude (a) evidence relating to Grant’s
2007 arrest and conviction for gun possession, including the fact that Grant was a felon on
probation at the time of that arrest, (b) proof that at the time of the January 1, 2009, shooting
Grant was on parole release after his conviction for the 2007 gun arrest, and (c) evidence that
Grant had been drinking alcohol in the hours before the shooting, as proven by his elevated blood
alcohol level.

As will appear, this evidence is both highly relevant and unquestionably admissible.
Moreover, its probative value far outweighs any prejudice to the prosecution, and its.admission
will not lead to undue consumption of time or juror confusion. Finally, exclusion of the evidence

would amount to federal due process error.

a. Evidence Relating to Grant’s 2007 Arrest and Conviction for Gun Possession
and His Probationary Status at the Time of that Arrest

Just over two years before the shooting, Oscar Grant and two friends were riding in a car in
San Leandro. (Exhibit A, Police Report). At the time, Grant was on felony probation, having
been convicted for a narcotics offense in early 2006. Police made a traffic stop. The officer saw
what he believed to be a handgun in Grant’s pocket, though Grant denied that he was armed.
Grant opened the rear passenger door and took off running. Police gave chase, ordering Grant to

stop, but he did not.

Eventually the police used a TASER. It hit Grant, causing him to fall to the ground, Grant
tried to get rid of the gun. With Grant now on the ground, officers ordered him to show his
hands, but Grant refused to show his left arm or hand. An officer had to kick Grant several times
to get him to comply. Finally the officers arrested and cuffed Grant. Police eventually recovered
his gun—a loaded .380 caliber pistol.

Following the arrest, police discovered that Grant’s probationary status, and therefore
charged him for the following offenses: (a) §12021(a)(1)(felon in possession of a firearm, (b)
§12025(a)(1)(felon in possession of a concealed firearm in a vehicle), (c) §12031(a) (convicted
felon in possession of a loaded firearm), and (d) 148(a)(1)(resisting arrest).

Following the 2007 arrest and various gun and resisting charges, Grant again pled guilty—
this time to the §12021(a)(1), felon in possession of a firearm count, and was sentenced to sixteen
months in state prison. The conviction was his third felony conviction. Grant was released on.
parole in August 2007 and remained on parole on January 1, 2009.

The preliminary hearing judge excluded evidence of the gun incident, holding that unless
Mehserle took the stand, the evidence was inadmissible. The magistrate cited no authority for
such a stopoeition, And in deciding defendant’s §995 motion the Superior Court acknowledged
the ruling was erroneous.

Section §1103 says this: “(a) In a criminal action, evidence of the character or a trait of
character (in the form of an opinion, evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of
earcinet} of the victim of the crime for which the defendant is being prosecuted is not made
inadmissible by Section 1101 if the evidence is: .. . Offered by the defendant to prove conduct of
the victim in conformity with the character or trait of character.”

In other words, a criminal defendant can offer evidence that the victim in the case has a bad
character, including evidence of prior bad acts by the victim, so long as that evidence is offered to
prove that the victim acted in conformity with that character trait at the time of the charged

offense.

' Grant was arrested again for drug and vehicular offenses in June of 2008. He was returmed to state prison until

 

 

 

 

September of 2008. Defendant does not seek to introduce those offenses into evidence.

That, of course, is precisely the situation here, Mehserle’s position is that Grant behaved in
such a way—vigorously resisting arrest—so as to justify the officer’s decision to employ a
TASER. Similarly, as the Court will learn, the defense position is that because Grant would not
give up his arms, and appeared to be moving one arm toward the waistband of his pants, Mehserle
believed Grant might be going for a gun. It was that belief that caused Mehserle to decide to use
a TASER, just as the officer did when the armed Grant refused to comply with police orders in
October 2006.

Under Evidence Code §1103(a) Mehserle is entitled use evidence of Grant’s character in
support of his defense. Defendant is entitled to place before the jurors circumstantial evidence—
in the form of specific prior bad acts——that Grant is the sort of person or had the sort of character
that would lead him to behave during the relevant events in the manner asserted by the defense—
resisting arrest, possibly due to his probationary status, refusing to give up his arms during an
attempted arrest, and vigorously resisting arrest. .

Longstanding California law supports the admission of the evidence precisely as described.
Indeed, California courts have held that the right of a defendant to offer the evidence of the
alleged victim’s character for violence—which, of course, is precisely the type of evidence at
issue here—tises to a due process right under the federal constitution. People v. Mizchele (1983)
142 Cal. App.3d 686, 691, citing Chambers v. Mississippi (1973) 410 U.S. 284, 302.

In Mizchele, the defendant was accused of killing his wife. He claimed at trial that-during
an argument he picked up his wife’s coat in an effort to remove a gun he knew was inside the
jacket to avoid her using it— the gun went off accidentally. The trial court excluded evidence
that the wife had been violent in the past, including on occasions with others than the defendant.
The court of appeal reversed, holding that the evidence was admissible on Mizhele’s defense that
the shooting had been an unintentional accident, 142 Cal.App.3d at 691.

Most important to this Court’s analysis is the fact that the evidence in Mizchele of the
victim’s character was deemed admissible on two distinet bases. First, the evidence was
admissible to prove the defendant’s state of mind at the time of the offense. So, for example,

where a defendant asserts self-defense, and is aware that the victim has acted violently in the past,

the victim’s violent history has powerful relevance to the defendant’s state of mind and therefore
his intent at the time of the alleged offense. See People v. Rowland (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 790,
797 (“It has long been recognized that where self-defense is raised in a homicide case, evidence
of the aggressive and violent character of the victim is admissible.”)

At the preliminary hearing, the magistrate took the view that because Mehserle did not
testify he could not say he was aware of Grant’s prior offense. And if the basis for admission

described above—that is, state of mind—were the only one relied up by Mizchele, the court

| would have been right.

But there was a separate and entirely independent basis for admission. Notwithstanding the

| defendant’s awareness of victim’s violent history, the Mizchele court held the evidence

admissible under §1103(a) to prove that the victim acted violently on the occasion of the charged
offense—that is, that the victim acted in conformity with a character for violence proven by his
prior bad acts. See also People v. Rowland (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 790, 797. The ruling in no
way relied on the defendant’s awareness of the prior bad acts, and exclusion of the evidence
amounted to due process error without regard for the defendant’s awareness of the character
evidence.

Thus, contrary to the magistrate’s view, it makes no difference whatsoever whether
Mehserle was aware of Grant’s prior acts of resistance, probationary status, and gun possession.
Under longstanding California law, because the character evidence (here in the form of prior bad
acts) was offered to prove that Grant behaved in conformity with that character trait during the
incident that led to criminal charges against Mehserle, it was admissible without regard to

Mehserle’s awareness. And, as in Mizchele, any exclusion of the evidence interfered with

‘ Mehserle’s right to present a defense and therefore would comprise federal due process error.

To see how clearly this rule is established and how the magistrate’s ruling ran afoul of the
evidence code, turn the tables for a moment. Assume for the moment that a hypothetical
defendant, Smith, was charged with assault on Officer Mehserle. Can this Court say that Smith,

in an effort to assert self-defense, would not be able to offer evidence that Officer Mehserle had

- improperly used force on ten defendants in the past if he could not prove that he was aware of

those incidents at the time he assaulted Mehserle?

As California courts have long held, Smith would indisputably be entitled to offer such
evidence under § 1103(a). See, e.g., Lemelle v. Superior Court (1978) 77 Cal.App.3d 148
(Evidence of officer's tendency to violence, whether in the form of opinion, evidence of
reputation, or evidence of specific acts of conduct, is admissible in prosecution in which
defendant is charged with battery on a police officer and resisting arrest.); Kelvin L. v. Superior
Court (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 823 (evidence of prior acts of unwarranted or excessive violence by
arresting officer would be admissible at juvenile's trial for battery on police officer on issue of
self-defense.) -

As appears, the evidence of Grant’s 2007 gun arrest and his probationary status at the time
of that arrest is admissible. As noted, its exclusion would comprise federal due process error,

Neither should the court exclude the evidence pursuant to Evidence Code §352. The
defense will present a single witness on the subject—the officer who stopped and arrested Grant.
and who eventually recovered the gun. The testimony should not be long: the officer will
describe the events, and will testify as to Grant’s probationary status. There is no need for the
jurors to learn why Grant was on probation in late 2006.

‘The evidence is highly probative on the subject of Grant’s character—indeed, in some
respects the incidents are eerily similar: in both instances Grant, subject to serious sanction due to
his probationary/parole status, refused to comply with police orders and resisted arrest, in both
cases he refused to give up his arms for cuffing, and in both cases Grant’s resistance to detention
and/or arrest compelled officers to use force in the form of a TASER.

The evidence is not at all prejudicial. Although the incident does not make Grant look like
an angel, neither does it so besmirch his character that any juror is likely to acquit simply because
of Grant’s criminal history. Rather, the evidence allows the jurors to understand who Grant was,
and the sort of decisions he might have made on January 1, 2009, regarding willingness to be
arrested without use of force by police.

Finally, nothing about the evidence would confuse or distract the jurors—it is being
introduced on the central issue in the case: did Grant resist arrest on January 1, 2009, such that
Mehserle was justified in deciding to use his TASER.

b. Evidence that Grant Was on Parole at the Time of the 2009 Shooting

Evidence that Grant was on parole at the time of the 2009 shooting is admissible for similar
reasons and under the same authorities. Likewise, exclusion of the evidence would amount to
federal due process error. Finally, evidence of Grant’s parole status should not be precluded
under §352.

Again, a key factual dispute in this case is whether Grant was actively resisting arrest
during the January 1, 2009, incident, thus justifying Mehserle’s decision to use his TASER. In
that regard, the jurors may reasonably ask themselves why Grant did not simply allow himself to
be arrested. The clearest answer to that question is that perhaps more than anyone on the
platform that night, Grant had reason to avoid arrest—had would almost certainly have been
headed back to state prison.

Grant ran during the 2006 gun arrest because he was on probation and was a felon and
knew that if he were caught he would likely be going to state prison. He refused to be detained,
ran, leading to the use of a TASER. Grant then continued to resist, refusing to give up his arms
for cuffing. The police officer involved had to kick Grant in order to get him to submit.

As noted, Grant’s circumstance was more problematic in January 2009—he was on parole,
and he was no doubt aware that if he were arrested for resisting arrest or for fighting, there was a
substantial likelihood that he would be sent back to San Quentin.

Defendant has a federal due process right to offer proof of Grant’s motive to resist on
January 1, 2009—such proof being circumstantial proof that Grant did resist up to the time of the
shooting—but defendant cannot meaningfully do so without introducing evidence that Grant was
on parole at the time. Such evidence can be introduced quickly, and in a manner that need not be

unduly prejudicial or confusing to the jury.

c. Evidence that Grant Had Been Drinking Alcohol in the Hours Before the
2009 Shooting

One of Grant’s parole conditions was that he “totally abstain from the use or possession of
any alcoholic beverages, liquors, or self-prescribed medications with alcohol.” Toxicology
reports done at Highland hospital after shooting establish that, Grant had been drinking in the
hours prior to the shooting. Thus, Grant knew that if he were detained and his blood alcohol
tested, he would be found to have violated his parole conditions and would be subject to
reincarceration.

As with Grant’s parole status, the fact that he was drinking is relevant not because it makes
Grant look bad—~it was New Years Eve, after all—but rather because it explains his conduct.
Again, Mehserle is entitled to offer circumstantial evidence that Grant resisted arrest up to the
time of the shooting in form of proof that he had a strong motivation to do 30. Because of the no
alcohol parole condition, Grant had a powerful reason to avoid detention and arrest—if the police
discovered he had been drinking, the consequence would have been a trip back to state prison.

As with the evidence discussed above, there is nothing so complicated or confusing or
prejudicial about these facts that would make them excludable under §352. But the evidence is
critical to Mehserle’s defense with regard to perhaps the central factual dispute in the case. For
that reason, and relying on the foregoing authorities, the exclusion of evidence that Grant had
been drinking would amount to federal due process error.

6. To ADMIT EVIDENCE THAT OSCAR GRANT WAS INVOLVED IN A FIGHT ON THE BART
TRAIN, WHICH INCIDENT PRECIPITATED HIS DETENTION AND ARREST

Although the incident was the subject of much testimony at the preliminary hearing during
both the prosecution and defense cases, and was discussed in detail in the prosecution’s trial brief,
defendant presumes in making this motion that the prosecution will seek to exclude pursuant to
§352 evidence that Oscar Grant was involved in a fight on the BART train on January 1, 2009.

It was, of course, that incident that led the train operator to summon police, which led to the

detention of Grant and his friends, and which ultimately precipitated Grant’s arrest. The incident

is therefore relevant simply to explain what preceded and precipitated the events on the BART
platform.

It is true, of course, that Grant was not arrested for fightirig; rather, Officer Pirone informed
Mehserle that Grant was under arrest for resisting. But without informing the jury of the reason
for the original detention, the conduct of the officers in this case—that is, those who began the
detention, and ultimately Mehserle, who entered late in the process—would appear to be

irrational. Without evidence of the train fight, the jury will be left to speculate about the reason.

“for the detention. The evidence is highly probative.

Evidence that Grant fought on the train, like the evidence that he was on parole at the time
of the shooting, is also relevant and admissible under §1103 as evidence of his character for
violence and aggression. It is also relevant to establish circumstantially Grant’s awareness that if
the police detained him for fighting or some other violent behavior, as was true of his use of
alcohol, he would have been subject to parole violation and thus incarceration in state prison.

The fight evidence is also not particularly consumptive of time or prejudicial or confusing.

The proof will be straightforward, although there is some disagreement about the seriousness of

the fight. As with the gun offense and probationary/parole evidence, while the BART train fight

does not make Grant look particularly good, it also would not demonize him in a way that would
unduly prejudice the state. And there is nothing about the evidence that would confuse or distract
the jurors. Indeed, as noted, the jurors require education on how Grant and the others ended up
on the platform, and there is no way to explain that circumstance without informing them of the
fight.

7. To EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OF A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BART OFFICER
ANTHONY PIRONE AND BART OFFICER MARYSOL DOMENICI

Officer Anthony Pirone and Officer Marysol Domenici were the two BART officers who
artived at the Fruitvale BART station in response to the call of a fight on the train, There have
been allegations in the civil case in this matter that they were sexually involved with each other

and that some of the actions they took that night were because of their relationship.

status or any discipline imposed has no probative value whatsoever as to any matter in dispute in

9, To EXCLUDE EVIDENCE WHICH REFERS TO OR RELIES ON THE MEYERS NAVE
REPORT DATED JULY 31, 2009 PREPARED FOR BART

BART hired the law firm of Meyers Nave to investigate the actions of the officers present
during the incident in question to determine if they acted within policy and procedure. In a report
dated July 31, 2009, Meyers Nave made findings and recommendations, which focused primarily
on Officer Pirone’s and Officer Domenici’s conduct. Meyers Nave was not hired to determine if
Officer Mehserle intended to fire a TASER as opposed to a gun,

Defendant anticipates that the District Attorney intends to offer the report, or portions of
that report. The report should be excluded as inadmissible hearsay. Also, the report is irrelevant
to any issue in dispute in this case. It should also be excluded pursuant to Evidence Code § 352,
because its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time and (b) create substantial
danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, and of misleading the jury.

In order to establish if Meyers Nave’s findings are correct, the court would have to conduct
a mini-trial regarding the accuracy of the information proffered by Meyers Nave in reaching its
conclusions. This would necessitate undue consumption of time. Its use in this case could
prejudice Mehserle as a result of its-criticism of BART policing in general, but has little probative
value on any issue in dispute in this case.

The criminal case does not concern whether the Meyers Nave firm concluded that Officer
Pirone’s or Officer Domenici’s conduct was inappropriate that night, whether the parties worked
properly as a team, whether the parties communicated properly to each other, or whether BART’s
policies invite transparency and accountability. The report thus has no relevance in this
proceeding.

Finally, introduction of the report, which relies on the testimony of various witnesses and

experts, would raise serious hearsay and Sixth Amendment confrontation problems as well, all of

_which would have to be sorted out before the Report or any part of it was placed into evidence.

10. To EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY REGARDING OFFICER MEHSERLE
“FLEEING” TO NEVADA

Defendant anticipates that the District Attorney may attempt to present evidence that
Officer Mehserle “fled” to Nevada after the incident, to show a consciousness of guilt. The
District Attorney’s own actions, detailed below, indicate that the District Attorney knew the
defendant did not “flee” to Nevada. Indeed, former DA Orloff made a public statement that his
office did not consider the fact that Mehserle was arrested in Nevada to comprise evidence that
Mehserle was attempting to avoid detention, arrest, or trial.

Any evidence of defendant going to Nevada should be excluded pursuant to Evidence Code

§ 352, because its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time and (b) create

" substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, and of misleading the jury.

In order to establish if defendant “fled” to Nevada, the court would have to conduct a
lengthy trial-within-a-trial regarding the circumstances surrounding defendant’s decision to leave
California. If the District Attorney is allowed to go forward with this evidence, defendant will
defend his actions by presenting evidence (a) of the death threats against him; (b) that the District
Attorney knew he could reach defendant through his attorney at any time but, instead, chose to
engage in inappropriate and unlawful conduct to try to obtain a statement from defendant; (c) that
the District Attorney had actual knowledge of defendant’s location before and at the time of
arrest; and (d) that the District Attorney’s claim in various court proceedings (which directly
conflicted with the statement described above) that defendant was a flight risk was made solely
for political reasons, to appease an angry public.

Regarding the District Attorney's actions, the DA knew who was representing defendant at
all times and knew he could contact defendant through his attorney. He further knew that
defendant had exercised his right not to be questioned without his counsel present. If the DA
pursues a consciousness of guilt argument or instruction, the defendant would be forced to
introduce evidence that former District Attorney Tom Orloff enlisted the assistance of Oakland
police officers to interview defendant, sans counsel, at midnight on January 13, 2009 in violation

of his Constitutional rights shortly after defendant had been arrested.

The DA should not be able to introduce evidence in support of a flight or consciousness of
guilt argument when the DA knows that the defendant did not flee, and said so in the newspaper.
Given the circumstances described above and in more detail elsewhere in this case, it ought to be
clear that if the issue is placed before the jury there would be a substantial danger of undue
prejudice, of confusing the issues, and of misleading the jury.

11. To EXCLUDE EVIDENCE OR TESTIMONY THAT JOHANNES MEHSERLE RESIGNED
FROM His EMPLOY WITH THE BART POLICE DEPARTMENT

On January 7, 2009, the defendant resigned from his position as a police officer at BART
Police Department. On February 19, 2010, Deputy District Attorney David Stein filed the
People’s Trial Brief in this matter with the Alameda County Superior Court. In that Trial Brief,
Mr, Stein noted this fact. (See p. 5 of the Trial Brief) Thus, the defendant anticipates that the
prosecution intends to present evidence on this nature.

First, evidence or testimony of this nature. offers little to no relevance in the criminal trial
and, therefore, necessitates exclusion. (Evid. Code § 210; People v. Warner (1969) 270
Cal.App.2d 900; People v. Slocum (1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 867, 891.) This anticipated evidence
has no legal significance to the vital issues in this case. (People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4"
1060, 1124-1125.)

Second, this evidence should be excluded pursuant to section 352 of the Evidence. By
permitting this issue, significant time will be spent, by the prosecution and defense alike, an
issues concerning employment law, BART employment policies, Internal Affairs investigations,
discipline procedures in general and specific to BART, etc. As previously stated, permitting
commentary on and/or evidence about the defendant’s resignation may force the defense to bring
in rebuttal witnesses in the form of evidence or testimony from current or prior defense counsel,

which would, of course, eviscerate on the defendant’s attorney-client privilege.

12. To EXCLUDE DIRECT OR IMPEACHMENT EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT RELATING TO
JOHANNES MEHSERLE EXERCISE OF His FIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE AGAINST
SELF-INCRIMINATION IN BOTH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATIONS OF THE OSCAR GRANT SHOOTING ‘

When investigators seek to question a California police officer about a matter that may
result in a criminal sanction, they are required to inform that officer of his constitutional rights,
including the right to remain silent in the face of such questioning. Govt. Code §3303(h);
Lybarger v. City of Los Angeles (1985) 40 Cal.3d 822, 829. The officer, too, is entitled to be
represented by counsel and to be informed of that right prior to any questioning, The advisement
contemplated by the statute is the same as required under Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S.
436, and must be given in the case of a criminal investigation or at any time an officer refuses to
answer investigator’s questions on self-incrimination grounds. 40 Cal.3d at 829 n.1,

Unlike in the usual criminal case, where pre-arrest silence by a defendant may be a proper
subject of cross-examination’ (see Jenkins v. Anderson (1980) 447 U.S. 231), because of the
operation of §3303, in the police context such silence falls squarely within the protection of Doyle
v. Ohio (1976) 426 U.S. 610.

Put another way, whether or not he has been arrested, wen a California police officer is
covered by §3303, as was defendant Mehserle, and receives advisement of his rights, his refusal
to make any statement in reliance on that right may not be the subject of prosecution evidence or
argument, whether in its case-in-chief or in cross-examining the defendant.

As will appear, Mehserle’s refusal, upon the advice of counsel, to speak either to BART
investigators or to the Oakland police or District Attorney falls squarely within these protections.
The Court should therefore exclude any direct or impeachment evidence or argument relating to
Mehserle’s decision to remain silent in the face of questioning.

Within hours of the Grant shooting Mehserle was represented by counsel who joined him at

the Lake Merritt BART Station. Thereafter, BART investigators and representatives of the

2 Although there is conflict among the federal circuits on the issue, the California Court of Appeal recently held that
such pre-arrest silence may vot be used by the prosecution for any purpose other than impeachment of a testifying
defendant, and may not be used in the prosecution’s case-in-chief. See People v. Waldie (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 358.

Alameda District Attorney’s Office sought to question him, Mehserle was given the Miranda
advisement. Through his counsel, and expressly relying on his Fifth Amendment right to remain
silent, Mehserle declined to give a statement.

BART investigators thereafter sought to compel an administrative interview with Mehserle,
who was then still employed by BART. The interview was compulsory in the sense that while
Mehserle had a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, his failure to speak would have amounted
to insubordination that could have been grounds for administrative sanction, including
termination. See Lybarger, 40 Cal.3d at 827. As was his right under the circumstances, Mehserle
resigned rather than submitting to the compelled interview or, ebvecnatively; refusing to answer
any questions and subjecting himself to firing.

Finally, late on January 13, 2009, in a jail cell in Nevada, two Oakland police officers again
attempted to interview Mehserle. After they gave him the Miranda admonition, Mehserle
declined to give a statement.’

Under Doyle, the prosecution can make no use of Mehserle’s post-arrest silence for any
purpose in this criminal case. See People v. Champion (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 1440, 1447-1448
(no use in case-in-chief); People v. Evans (1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 358, 367 (no use as
impeachment evidence).

Moreover, because from the outset Mehserle faced with police and administrative
interviews, was covered by §3303, was therefore formally advised of his Miranda rights, and
expressly relied on his Fifth Amendment right in choosing not to give a statement, the
prosecution is similarly barred from using Mehserle’s pre-arrest silence for any purpose at trial.

That fact is made absolutely clear when one considers what would have happened had
Mehserle, then covered by §3303, decided to speak to administrative investigators. In that case
his statements—which are considered involuntary—would not have been admissible for any

purpose at the criminal trial, including impeachment. See New Jersey v. Portash (1979) 440 US.

3 As Mehserle has argued elsewhere, the attempt to seek a statement from Mehserle after his arrest, and long after he
had retained counsel, was a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel pursuant to Massiah v. United States
(1964) 377 U.S. 201.

450; compare Harris v. New York (1971) 401 U.S. 222 (statements obtained in violation of
Miranda, unlike those obtained involuntarily, may be used in cross-examination of a defendant).
It would be illogical to exclude the statements themselves, yet permit the DA to use evidence of
silence.

In the event this Court were to find that evidence or argument relating to Mehserle’s silence
is not constitutionally barred, it should nevertheless be excluded under Evidence Code §352. In
Jenkins the United States Supreme Court made clear that even where pre-arrest silence is
admissible to impeach a defendant without violating the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments, state
courts may insist that the evidence the prosecution seeks to offer is more probative than it is
prejudicial. Jenkins, 447 U.S. at 239.

Mehserle had a right under Government Code §3303 and by operation of the BART Police
Union contract to be represented by counsel in the case of a police-involved shooting. Counsel
arrived at the Lake Merritt BART Station, where Mehserle had been taken after the shooting.
Counsel then informed the investigators that Mehserle would exercise his Fifth Amendment right
not to give a statement or answer any questions. ,

In view of the chaotic circumstances at the Fruitvale BART platform, and given that by all
accounts Mehserle appeared to be in a state of shock after the shooting, it may well be that the
lawyer advised Mehserle not to provide a statement at that time, and that Mehserle simply
followed his advice without carefully contemplating the possible impact of that decision. If the
prosecution were to be able to offer evidence of Mehserle’s silence in support of a consciousness
of guilt theory, in that case, how probative would the evidence really be?

Also, if the prosecution attempts to use the silence evidence, certainly the defendant would
want to offer opposing proof that he was simply following the directives of his lawyer in
circumstances in which his own ability to make a reasoned judgment was compromised. But in
order to explore the issue fully, Mehserle would have to invade sanctity of the attorney-client
relationship, and might well be forced to waive the privilege in an effort to counter the

prosecution’s evidence. This Court should not put Mehserle in such an untenable position.

People v. Johannes Mehserle Case No. AOC 1009606-10

In any event, the process would be unwieldy and time-consuming. It would likely distract
the jurors from their primary task—that is, to determine whether Mehserle intended to use his gun
on January 1, 2009.

Finally, as noted, the evidence is of very little probative value. The admittedly serious
incident rapidly deteriorated into a — in the days after the shooting, with members of the
press, community and religious leaders, and politicians of all stripes calling Mehserle a murderer
before the investigators had finished their work. In that light, Mehserle’s decision not to speak—
until, perhaps, the relative calm of a criminal trial—-would seem to have more to do with
appreciating the futility in asserting that he accidentally shot Grant than with evidencing
consciousness of his own guilt.

On the other hand, the evidence could be extremely prejudicial, given that lay people often
attribute a failure to defend oneself in the face of criminal allegations by police or the media as a
proxy for an admission of guilt.

The evidence should be excluded on both Constitutional and §352 grounds.

13. To Apmit EXPERT TESTIMONY BY DEFENSE EXPERTS GREG MEYER AND WILLIAM —
J. LEWINSKI, Pu.D.

As the Court is by now aware, it will be Mehserle’s defense to the charge of malice murder
that he neither intended to kill nor to shoot Oscar Grant with his gun. Rather, justifiably intending
to use his TASER, and after announcing that intent, Mehserle mistakenly and accidentally pulled
and fired his service weapon. Compare Torres v. City of Madera (9" Cir. 2008) 524 F.3d 1053;
Henry v. Purnell (4" Cir. 2007) 501 F.3d 374; Torres v. City of Madera (E.D. CA 2009) 655
F.Supp.2d 1109, 1123; see also Atak v. Siem (D. MN 2005) 2005 WL 2105545 *2.

At the preliminary hearing defendant sought to introduce highly qualified expert testimony
on matters that are central to his defense: for example, how officers should be trained to use
TASERs; how Mehserle’s training fell far short; how as a result of his inadequate and incomplete

training the chance of an accident of precisely the sort that occurred in this case was

greatly increased; and how, based on the physical evidence, it is the expert’s conclusion that
Mehserle attempted to deploy his TASER but mistakenly fired his gun.

The preliminary hearing court excluded expert testimony on the training and use of
TASERs. When Mehserle challenged the magistrate’s ruling in his motion pursuant to Penal
Code §995, arguing that exclusion of this key evidence was federal due process error, the
Superior Court found that the defendant’s proffer had been inadequate. The §995 court declined
to reach the merits of Mehserle’s constitutional claim.

In an abundance of caution, therefore, and because Mehserle anticipates the District
Attorney will again seek to preclude the fact finder from considering this critical defense
evidence, Mehserle offers this legal analysis and offer of proof relating to two of his proposed
expert witnesses. Mehserle of course reserves the right to seek the admission of additional expert
evidence-—-in the form of expanded subject matter from the two experts identified here, or
through other experts—as the case proceeds.

a. The Law

There are four fundamental and overlapping limitations on expert testimony in California.

First, an expert may offer opinion testimony only on subjects “sufficiently beyond common
experience that the opinion of an expert would assist the trier of fact.” Evidence Code §801 (a);
People v. Cole (1956) 47 Cal.2d 99, 103. “Even though facts may be within the knowledge or
understanding of the trier of fact, the conclusions to be drawn therefrom may require expert
testimony. The decisive consideration in determining the admissibility of expert opinion evidence
is whether the subject of inquiry is one of such common knowledge that men of ordinary
education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness or whether, on the other hand,
the matter is sufficiently beyond common experience that the opinion of an expert would assist
the trier of fact.” People v. Harvey (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1206, 1227 (internal quotation marks
and citations omitted).

Second, under Evidence Code §803, a court may not admit “testimony in the form of an

opinion that is based in whole or in significant part on matter that is not a proper basis for such an

opinion.” For example, where an expert bases his or her opinion on matters not reasonably relied
upon by other experts in the field, the opinion evidence is siadlintusible,

Third, pursuant to Evidence Code §720, “A person is qualified to testify as an expert only if
he or she has sufficient knawiedue, skill, experience, training or education to qualify as an expert
on the subject matter of his or her testimony.”

Finally, while courts have been hesitant to permit experts to pronounce opinion on the
ultimate guilt or linooanee of a defendant (see People v. Torres (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 37, 46-47
(citing cases); People v. Stoll (1989) 49 Cal.3d 1136, 1149 n.13), Evidence Code §805 provides
that “Testimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable
because it embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.”

In other words, while an expert cannot tell a jury to convict, he or she can render a qualified,
properly based opinion, even though it treads on the jury’s.ultimate obligation to decide the facts
of the case. As the court of appeal said in People v. Harvey (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1206, 1227:

Testimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is

-. not objectionable because it embraces the ultimate issue to be
decided vibe trier of fact. We believe .. . that there is no hard and’
fast rule that experts may not be asked questions that coincide with
the ultimate issue in the case, and that the true rule is that
admissibility depends on the nature of the issue and the
circumstances of the case, there being a large measure of discretion
involved. We believe further that the modern tendency is against
making a distinction between evidentiary and ultimate facts as
subjects of expert opinion.

(Internal quotation marks and citations omitted)

Many cases in varying contexts have so held. See People v. Olguin (1994) 31 Cal.App.4th
1355, 1370 (officer permitted to offer opinion on ultimate issue in the case, which was whether
the defendant was a member of a gang); People v. Doss (1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1585, 1596 (police
officer permitted to testify on ultimate issue, which was whether the drugs possessed by the
defendant were intended for sale; court notes that “Tt is neither unusual nor impermissible for an
expert to testify to an ultimate issue, and such opinions are expressly contemplated by Evidence

Code section 805”); Paez v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d

1025, 1026 (officer could testify on ultimate issae—whether customer in bar was obviously

- Moving to the key issue in this case, experts have often been called upon to provide
insights and opinions relating to the question whether a certain set of facts might or might not
have been the result of an accident and/or how a particular outcome might have resulted given a
particular set of facts. See, e.g., People v. Harbert (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 42, 50 (defense
accident reconstruction expert explains how defendant might not have seen the victim in time to
avoid hitting her with his car); People v. Tackett (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 445, 451 (crime scene
reconstruction experts on both sides offer opposing testimony regarding whether the defendant
could have been driving the truck that led to a fatality); People v, Wattier (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th
948, 952 (prosecution expert testifies that accident and fatality was caused by unsafe and erratic
driving on part of defendant); People v. Singh (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1343, 1377 (officer could
offer opinion whether automobile accident had been staged); People v. Marsh (1985) 175

could not have been accidental); People v. Smith (1983) 196 Cal.Rptr. 106 (unpublished)(defense

b. The Proposed Expert Testimony
i, Greg Meyer
1. Offer of Proof

Defense expert Greg Meyer is a nationally recognized expert in the field of use of force. He
has 34 years of law enforcement experience. See Exhibit A, Greg Meyer CV. Meyer is a retired as
a Captain with the Los Angeles Police Department. He has more than 30 years experience with
TASERs, including research, testing, instructor training, and use in tactical situations. He has
written and lectured widely on various law enforcement subjects including TASER training and
deployment and use of force. Mr. Meyer, while Captain of the Los Angeles Police Academy from
2004-2006, commanded units that taught firearm and TASER use. Mr. Meyer has consulted in

more than 100 criminal, civil, and administrative cases, including numerous officer-involved

shootings and TASER-related cases. Mr. Meyer has testified for and against police officers in
criminal, civil, and administrative cases, including officer-involved shooting cases, TASER cases,
and use of force cases.‘

Mr. Meyer will offer testimony as follows (notably, some of what follows falls into the
category of facts considered by Meyer, upon which his conclusions rely; some are the conclusions
themselves):°

1. Mr. Meyer has reviewed investigation reports, witness interviews, and all of the
relevant documentary and physical evidence relating to the Oscar Grant shooting,
including videotapes;

2. Mr. Meyer has conducted personal interviews with the BART training officers who
conducted TASER training of the defendant on December 3, 2008. He has also
reviewed the videotape of the defendant being tased during the course of that training
class; .

3, Mr. Meyer is thoroughly familiar with the TASER X26 carried by the Defendant on
January 1, 2009, and is aware of the manner in which it was carried on the defendant’s .
equipment belt;

4, Meyer is also thoroughly aware of the firearm carried by the defendant on January 1,
2009 and the manner in which that firearm would commonly be drawn from the
Safariland ALS Holster carried by the defendant on the date at issue;

5. Mr. Meyer is thoroughly familiar and has-studied approximately six other documented
incidents prior to January 1, 2009, in which police officers intended to deploy their
TASERs and/or announced their intention to deploy their TASERs and, instead and by

mistake, drew and fired service weapons;

{tt

4 This brief contains a summary statement of Mr. Meyer’s qualifications to give the Court a clear sense that the
expert is qualified to offer opinions in the subject areas that follow. He will, of course, be fully qualified at trial.

5 Mehserle has attempted to be complete in his general description of the proposed Meyer testimony. He of course
reserves the right to add or subtract areas of evidence depending on the prosecution’s case.

6. Mr. Meyer is familiar with various civil actions that have ensued as a result of those

prior matters and where available has read judicial opinions relating to those cases;

. Based upon Mr. Meyer’s review of the evidence in this case, including statements of

witnesses describing Mehserle’s reaction to the shooting, and evidence that Mehserle
stated his intention to tase Mr. Grant just prior to firing the fatal round, it is Mr. Meyer’s
expert opinion that the fatal shooting of Oscar Grant by defendant Johannes Mehserle
was an accident resulting from Mehserie’s attempt to use a TASER and his mistaken

use of his firearm instead;

. Mr. Meyer will testify that defendant’s decision and attempt to use the TASER was

objectively reasonable and proper according under the circumstances, the relevant law,
BART policy, and the training the defendant had received prior to January 1, 2009
concerning deployment of the TASER;

. Mr. Meyer will also testify concerning numerous instances in which the TASER has

been deployed by police officers in an attempt to avoid the use of lethal force against
police officers by suspects—i.e., instances in which officers might have resorted to the
use of firearms but, instead, chose to deploy TASERs in the face of the threat of the use

of lethal force against them.

Mr. Meyer will also provide testimony as follows:

10. It was objectively reasonable under the law, their training, and the circumstances for

BART officers to detain subjects they reasonably believed were involved in the fight on

the train;

11. It was objectively reasonable under the law, their training, and the circumstances for the

officers to handcuff those subjects;

12. Grant unlawfully physically resisted detention in violation of Penal Code § 148a;

13, Grant's resistance caused the officers' efforts to bring him under control to be

prolonged;

14. Various factors, including the increase in noise on the BART platform, the large

number of bystanders compared to police officers, and the justifiable conclusions of the

officers that the crowd could become aggressive, escalated ‘tensions and stresses in the
incident and are circumstances relevant to the question whether Mehserle acted in an
objectively reasonable manner during the Grant detention;

15. Police may use force to make an arrest, overcome resistance, or prevent escape.and to
defend themselves or others from bodily harm;

16. Under the circumstances, training, and law, the force used to attempt to subdue and
handcuff Grant prior to the shooting was an objectively reasonable use of force to
overcome Grant’s unlawful resistance;

17. Grant physically resisted the lawful control efforts of the officers by secreting his right
arm under his body and resisting the efforts of Officer Mehserle to pull it out;

18. Officer Mehserle engaged in prolonged physical efforts to gain control of Grants right
arm with the apparent intent to handcuff Grant;

19, Grant repeatedly contorted his body by twisting and turning and bucking against the
officer's attempts to control him and handcuff him;

20. Various facts apparent from the physical evidence as well as his training, it is apparent
that Officer Mehserle determined to deploy the TASER to attempt to contro] Grant;

=

. Under the law, his training, and the circumstances, the decision to deploy the TASER
was an objectively reasonable decision, after conventional soft empty-handed tactics
failed to control Grant;

22. The TASER is typically far less injurious than hard-hands tactics or blunt force

instruments, which were the next level of force above what the officers were using on

Grant;

23. If Officer Mehserle observed or perceived that Grant's hand was entering his waistband

w

or pants pocket area, it was likely that Officer Mehserle's level of fear would escalate,
and in that case, under the law, the circumstances and his training, it was objectively
reasonable for Officer Mehserle to deploy a TASER to stop Grant's actions;

24, Officer Mehserle loudly announced that he was going to use the TASER on Grant;

25. Officer Mehserle’s ultimately failed attempt to draw the TASER impacted by the
stresses of the moment and inadequate training and experience with the TASER;

26. Officer Mehserle had great difficulty drawing his weapon, a fact proven by the
contorted actions of his right hand and thumb, which seemed be employing TASER
unholstering techniques on the gun holster;

27, Officer Mehserle accidentally drew his handgun instead of his TASER;

28, Officer Mehserle stood up and positioned his right hand and right arm in a manner
entirely consistent with an intention to deploy a TASER—namely he attempted to
create a sufficient spread between the two TASER darts to achieve a neuromuscular
incapacitation and stop Grant's resistance;

29. Officer Mehserle's position immediately before the shot was entirely inconsistent with
an attempt to shoot a handgun;

30. The physical evidence uniformly supports the claim that Officer Mehserle believed he
was firing a TASER, not a handgun, when he fired the single shot;

3

=

, Officer Mehserle's physical actions and facial expressions immediately after firing the

shot ate indicative of shock and surprise;

32. Officer Mehserle's announcement that he was going to use the TASER on Grant and his
statement shortly afterward to Officer Pirone that he (Mehserle) thought that Grant was
going for a gun, are not at all inconsistent with each other or with an attempt to deploy
the TASER;

33. Meyer is aware of dozens of incidents in which police officers were either concerned
about an imminent deadly threat from a suspect, or actually faced such a threat, and
chose to use TASERs to end the incident without deploying deadly force;

34, A suspect’s back has been the preferred TASER target area for more than 30 years;

3

Ww

. Using a TASER to overcome physical resistance is entirely consistent with BART
policy and is typical of other TASER policies throughout the world;
3

a

. As the result of three different TASER holster configurations issued to officers on

different shifts, BART officers did not become sufficiently familiar with the equipment

to achieve the muscle memory required to perform automatically in emergency
_ situations;

37. The fact that Mehserle had use of the TASERs for only one month before the Grant
shooting greatly increased the risk of the sort of accidental shooting that occurred;

38. By not incorporating realistic, dynamic, interactive, stress-inducing tactical scenarios
during TASER training, BART did not adequately prepare its officers for the realities of
tactical decision-making and TASER use in the real world;

39. Other than the fact of the shooting itself, there exists no physical evidence that Officer
Mehserle attempted to use deadly force on January 1, 2009.

2. Argument for Admissibility
After they hear the opening arguments of counsel—the DA stating his belief that the

 

shooting was intentional, defense counsel stating his position that the shooting was an accident—-
there will naturally be two central questions in the minds of the jurors relating to Mehserle’s
asserted defense: first, how could a police officer make such a mistake? And second, why would
Mehserle have chosen to use his TASER in the first place?

Neither question is answerable by reference to the jurors’ common experience. And even if
some of the facts are within the jurors’ experience—say, the noise on the platform—the relevant
conclusions to be drawn therefrom require expert assistance. People v. Harvey (1991) 233
Cal. App.3d 1206, 1227. The defendant is entitled to offer evidence from a qualified expert in
order to assist the jurors to understand that Mehserle’s decision to use the TASER in this case was
entirely justified.

Mehserle is likewise entitled to offer expert testimony to assist the jurors in their
understanding of the physical evidence, and in particular the videotape. Meyer will explain, for
instance, how various circumstances apparent from the video—e.g., Mehserle’s position, the
actions of his hand during long effort to unholster the gun, the manner in which he held the gun,
his conduct following the shooting—are consistent with an attempt to deploy the TASER and

inconsistent with an attempt to deploy his firearm.

Mehserle is also entitled to offer expert testimony that the mistake he made and the
accidental shooting that occurred was not at all a surprise under the specific circumstances—
inadequate and improper training, lack of experience in tactical situations, the particular stressors
at the BART platform, and so forth—and that the mistake was not the product of an conscious
disregard for human life. All of the categories of testimony listed above relate to these two
questions and Meyer is obviously qualified to offer his opinion accordingly.

Moreover, under the authorities discussed previously, Meyer should be allowed to render
his ultimate opinions that (a) Mehserle’s intent was to draw the TASER and not his firearm and
(b) Mehserle’s use of the gun rather than a TASER in this case was an accident and was not the
product of an intent on the part of the officer to employ deadly force.

A brief look back at the preliminary hearing suggests why such expert testimony on the
training and use of TASERs, as well as the proper use of non-lethal force, will be so critical to the
jurors ultimate decision on the murder charge. Recall, of course, that the magistrate had excluded
Meyer’s testimony. In the absence of that assistance, the magistrate concluded that Mehserle
intended to shoot and not to tase Grant. (PHT 1061) That conclusion was based two on two facts:
(a) that Mehserle had two hands on his weapon when he fired it and (b) that Mehserle drew the
weapon with his strong (i.e., dominant) hand, The magistrate concluded that both facts were
consistent with an intent to fire his gun, and:inconsistent with an intent to use the TASER. Here’s
what the court said: “The fact that he grabbed it with his right hand and the testimony is he took
two hands and shot down at the victim, tells me that it’s consistent with his intent to shoot the
victim at the time.” (PHT 1061)

Had the magistrate permitted Meyer to assist him in his understanding of the relevant facts,
the outcome of the preliminary hearing might have been very different. The expert would have
squarely contradicted the magistrate’s conclusion that the two-hand grip and the strong hand draw

support are inconsistent with Mehserle’s accident defense.

First, expert Meyer will explain at trial, there was nothing whatsoever about Mehserle’s
two-hand grip that was inconsistent with an attempt to use the TASER or a belief that he had the
TASER in his hand when he shot Grant. Indeed, a training video upon which Meyer’s relies in
part for his opinions proves the opposite. Meyers will testify that officers are ‘rained to use a
awechand grip when deploying the TASER. Similarly, the expert will make clear that the fact that
Mehserle grabbed the gun with his right (strong) hand is in no way inconsistent with an attempt to
deploy the TASER.

In case the Court chooses to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of involuntary
manslaughter, Meyer’s expert opinion becomes doubly relevant. As defendant has discussed in
detail in his Trial Brief on Instructional Issues, the focus of the jury’s attention, should they be
required to decide whether Mehserle was sufficiently reckless on the BART platform to warrant
an involuntary manslaughter conviction, would be (a) whether he was justified in using the
TASER under the circumstances (i.e., whether his conduct was objectively reasonable) and (b)
whether his mistake in firing his gun rather than his TASER demonstrated a level of recklessness
that suggests an indifference to the consequences. As the federal courts have found in the context
of §1983 cases involving the mistaken use ‘of a gun rather than a TASER, facts such as adequacy
of training, officer compliance with training, and factors distracting the officer fom his or her
training, including the conduct of a suspect, are highly relevant to the question of the officer’s
reasonableness. These are precisely the subjects of expert Meyer’s proposed testimony.

Finally, it must be said that given his importance to the defendant’s case, the exclusion of
Meyer’s expert opinion evidence in this case would amount to federal due process error. As the
United States Supreme Court held in Chambers v. Mississippi (1973) 410 U.S. 284, 302 (1973):
“Few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own
defense.”; see also Washington v. Texas (1967) 388 U.S. 14, 18-19 (due process error to exclude
defense evidence).

ii, William Lewinski
1. Offer of Proof

William Lewinski, PhD, is an expert on psychological and physiological factors
surrounding the use of force by police officers, including use of deadly force and officer-involved
shootings, He has been qualified in this and related areas and testified in civil and criminal
matters more than 150 times. See Exhibit B, William Lewinski CV. Dr. Lewinski, a professor at .
Minnesota State University, is currently the Director of the Force Science Research Center, which
is “dedicated to the study of human dynamics in high stress, rapidly unfolding force encounters.
Through classes and consultation, the Institute strives to facilitate the application of Force
Science concepts during investigations, training and the evaluation of the appropriateness of
officers' behavior during these encounters.”

Dr. Lewinski will offer testimony as follows:

1. He has reviewed evidence in this case which is relevant to making a determination
concerning psychological and physiological factors which may have impacted Officer
Mehserle’s observations, his thought processes and his responses during the events of
January 1, 2009. His review of evidence has included documentary evidence and
videotapes take of the incident in question;

2. He has reviewed Officer Mehserle’s training records and training history in the areas of
the use of a TASER and his training concerning use of a firearm. From his review of
written reports and materials, he is familiar with Mehserle’s prior experience in dealing
with subjects who are perceived to be a threat because of the placement of their hands
or other factors. He is familiar with and has personally conducted a variety of research
projects directly relevant to issues in this case including, but not limited to, (a) the threat
level of a prone subject who is suspected of having a gun in his hand or is reaching for a
gun; (b) the attentional resources that are directed to a threat and their effect on
perception, decision-making and response; (c) the role of training in developing

automaticity in behavior which can facilitate correct decision-making and performance

‘if

in high stress situations; and (d) training and behavioral elements that can lead to a

mistaken response in the type of circumstances involved in this incident;

. Based upon studies he has conducted and which are currently ongoing, Dr. Lewinski

will testify regarding the threat level that a prone subject poses to a police officer.
Specifically, he will describe research data demonstrating that a suspect prone on the .
ground who has a weapon either underneath his. body or in a pocket can draw and fire
the weapon at an officer who already has his weapon trained on a suspect and who has
his finger on the trigger of the weapon at a faster rate than the officer can return fire.
Research conducted by Dr. Lewinski has established that a prone suspect with a gun

underneath the body or in a front pocket can draw and fire the weapon between one

fourth of a second and two thirds of a second;

. Dr. Lewinski will testify how an officer’s training and experience influence how the

officer sees, interprets, and reacts to the behavior of a suspect. This will include

 

testimony concerning the fact that once an officer’s focus is directed to a particular area,
his ability to observe other potentially important things around the officer becomes

significantly impaired, causing something referred to as “inattentional blindness”;

. Dr. Lewinski will testify how inattentional blindness and the focus on a particular

isolated area of action which an officer perceives to be a potential threat will force the

officer to rely on automatic behavior to deal with the threat;

. Dr. Lewinski will explain the decision-making process that is most commonly used in a

highly threatening, visually and behaviorally complex, dynamic, and rapidly evolving

situation;

. Dr, Lewinski will explain that an officer is trained to perceive certain actions by

individuals as a threat and to respond with a certain pattern of behavior or an “automatic
procees.” Such ‘training does not involve mere mechanical issues—it must include
training on recognizing the pattern of behavior and formulating an appropriate and

instinctive response;

13.

In order for an officer to respond appropriately to a pattern of threatening behavior, the
officer needs to be trained that the response needs to be instinctive. Where there is
insufficient training, the response may not occur at all or may not be the desired
response;

Dr. Lewinski will testify regarding the training of police officers to develop
automaticity in behavior, which then can facilitate correct decision-making and
performance in daemening, visually and behaviorally complex, dynamic, and rapidly
evolving tactical situations;

Dr. Lewinski will explain what studies show concerning how often training must be
conducted to repeat the correct and desired response to a perceived pattern of conduct

so that the desired behavior/response becomes the default option;

. Dr. Lewinski will testify to the fact that inadequate and improper training can lead to

problems of inattentional blindness and what is sometimes referred to as “confirmation
bias,” where whatever information an officer is receiving during a stressful moment
erroneously signals to him that he has made the right choice to respond to a threat when
in fact, that is not the case at all;

Dr. Lewinski will testify that Mehserle’s reactions as shown on the video immediately
after the shot was fired are indicative of a response which he did not anticipate before
firing the shot;

Based upon a comprehensive study of the evidence in this case, his participation in
relevant research studies, and his awareness of relevant research in the field, Dr.
Lewinski will offer his opinion that, as a result of contextual factors, including
Mehserle’s prior training and experience, together with the presence of a wading of
factors which affected his attentional resources and, in turn, his perception, decision-
making, and response, together with his responses immediately following the firing of
the weapon, it is clear that Officer Mehserle accidentally drew and fired his firearm
rather than his TASER on January 1, 2009.

2. Argument for Admissibility
Dr. Lewinski is unquestionably qualified to offer analysis and opinion on the subject of

psychological and physiological factors surrounding the use of force by police officers. This
witness is an international leader in this field, having been regularly qualified in courts arourid the
country on these very issues, often on behalf of prosecutors. He is the director of an organization
that is solely dedicated to research in this area.

Like expert Meyer, Dr. Lewinski’s testimony is admissible on the key defense claim: that
Mehserle intended to use his TASER, but rather used his gun. Again, the jurors will fairly be
asking themselves, how is it a trained officer makes this sort of mistake? They require and
defendant is entitled to offer the jurors assistance in answering this question.

To recap, Meyers will testify regarding the justifiability of the intended use of force, will
explain how Mehserle’s lack of adequate or effective training made an accident more likely, and
will show how Mehserle’s conduct on January 1, 2009, was entirely consistent with an intent to
use his TASER and entirely inconsistent with an intent to use his gun.

Dr. Lewinski will explain how the inadequate and ineffective training, the fact that he had
not carried or used the TASER with any regularity, and the various circumstances present on
January 1, 2009—including, but not limited to, Grant’s position on the platform, the fact that
Grant refused to give up his arms for cuffing, the noise, the number of people on the platform, the
perceived threat level, and the fact that Mehserle was aware that guns had been retrieved from
BART riders that evening—led Mehserle to make the tragic mistake that officers in several other
cases made before him.

Jurors can certainly imagine the circumstances on the BART platform—they can
understand the noise, the chaos, and perhaps can even imagine that the officers felt outmanned
and under siege. But, as per People v. Harvey (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1206, 1227, while they
may understand these facts, they are in no position, without assistance from an expert like Dr.
Lewinski, to grasp how those factors and the others described above might have resulted in the

sort of confusion, and mistaken physiologic response, that led to the accidental shooting.

The question is simply whether this area is “of such common knowledge that men of
ordinary education could reach a conclusion as intelligently as the witness”—in other words,
whether Dr. Lewinski’s testimony would in no meaningful way assist the jurors in their
understanding of what happened on January 1, 2009. In fact, this expert’s many years studying
psychological and physiological factors surrounding the use of force by police officers in tactical
put him in a unique position to assist the jurors.

296\ HIDAS, ALEX, J, 10/15/2006 22:13
DETAILS: .

On 10/15/06, about 2105 hours, | was on duty in full police uniform and driving a marked patrol
vehicle (#361). | was driving W/B on Fargo Ave, when | noticed a vehicle traveling on-Fargo Ave
in the opposite direction (E/B). As the vehicle approached and passed me, | noticed all four head
lamps including the high beams were on, and the driver did not turn off the high beams, in
violation of 24409(a) V.C. The high beams affected my vision and | had to pull over temporarily.

| made a U-turn, caught up to the vehicle, and performed an enforcement stop in the parking lot of
‘the Techco Gas Station, 15201 Washington Ave. | noticed three occupants in the Vehicle, so |
requested another unit for assistance and Officér Deguzman was dispatched to assist me. |
. contacted the driver, (IP) ike Jackson Anderson, the front seat passenger, (IP) Michael Greer,
and the passenger sitting behind Greer, (AR) Oscar Grant. The driver stated he had his high
-| beams on because one of his head lamps is broken. The driver had no valid form of identification
and was later arrested per 40302(a) V.C.

| noticed Grant was not wearing his seat belt, in violation of 27315(d)(1) V.C., so! asked him to _
show me his identification. Grant was wearing a black jacket that was unzipped and blue jeans.
He moved his jacket aside and appeared to be checking all of his pockets, but he stated he left
his ID at home. As Grant moved his jacket away from his left front pant pocket, | noticed what
appeared to be the handle of a pistol inside his left front pant pocket. The handie was flat,
rectangular, and it was brown and biack.

For safety reasons, | told Grant to place his hands on the headrest of the front passenger seat. |
also told the driver to place his hands on the steering wheel, and the front passenger to place his
hands on the dashboard, and all parties complied, initially. | drew my firearm arid waited for
assistance, Grant moved his right arm away from the headrest, so | pointed my firearm at him
and ordered him to place his hands back on the headrest. | told Grant not to move because |
believed he was in possession of a firearm. Grant stated he had "weed" on him, but no gun.

M-APAaArZs

Suddenly, Grant opened the right rear passenger door, and fled on foot through the parking lot
and onto S/B Washington Ave. | chased Grant on foot and ordered him to stop and get on the
ground. Grant refused to stop and kept running. | advised SLPD Dispatch and continued after
Grant. Officer Deguzman arrived and followed Grant in his marked patrol vehicle onto the
property of Big O Tires on Washington Ave.

Grant refused to stop, so Officer Deguzman and | both chased Grant on foot through the
intersection of Washington Ave and Lewelling Bivd toward the ARCO Gas Station at 712
Lewelling Blvd. | advised that Grant was armed. Officer Deguzman caught up to Grant and ran
along side of him with his Taser (Less Lethal Weapon) pointed at Grant. Grant refused to stop,
so Officer Deguzman fired his Taser at Grant. 1140

lt appeared the Taser struck Grant in that he lost his balance and began to fall to the ground. As
he was falling, Grant threw the object believed to be a firearm into the air and it landed in the
parking lot of the ARCO gas station. Grant fell and collided with a parked vehicle in the parking
lot. His upper body was underneath the vehicle, and | could not see his left hand or arm.

CASE NARRATIVE CONTINUATION

 

Officer Deguzman and | both ordered Grant to show us his hands, but he did not bring his left arm
or hand behind his back or into our view. Since, | believed Grant was armed and had a weapon
in his left front pant pocket, and he refused to show me his left hand, | kicked Grant in the left side
of his upper body (about 2-3 times) until he brought his hand behind his back. Grant was
detained in hand cuffs without further incident.

| located the object Grant threw about 15-20 feet in front of him in the parking lot. The object was
a .380 caliber pistol with brown pistol grips. The pistol was the same pistol | saw in Grant's pocket
earlier. The pistol had a magazine attached to it and it appeared to be loaded. | brought the
pistol back to Officer Deguzman's location, and | began to return to the Techco Gas Station.

Since, | noticed and located a firearm on Grant while he was inside the vehicle, !| advised other
SLPD Officers to locate and perform a high risk stop on the vehicle back at the Techco Gas
Station. Other SLPD Officers arrived, completed a high risk vehicle stop, and detained the
remaining two occupants. | searched the vehicle incident to arrest, but | did not locate any other
weapons or anything illegal inside the vehicle. Both parties were pat searched for weapons, but
none were found in their possession. Greer was released, but | arrested Anderson per 40302(a)
V.C. Officer Teng transported Anderson -to the SLPD Jail for booking. (See SLPD Case 2006-
41643).

| returned to the ARCO Gas Station. Officer Ruff arrived as the evidence technician. He
photographed and recovered the pistol, performed a records check on the pistol, and submitted it
into SLPD Property as evidence. He advised me the pistol was loaded with one unexpended
bullet in the chamber and 5 unexpended bullets in the magazine. The records check did not
produce any exact matches for the pistol, and it was not listed as being stolen.

A records check on Grant revealed he is a convicted Felon, and he is on active probation with a
four way (S7) search clause for a violation of 11377 HandS and 11359 HandS. Therefore, |
arrested Grant upon probable cause for a violation of 12021(a)(1) P.C. (Convicted Felon in
possession of a firearm), 12025(b)(1) P.C. (Convicted Felon in possession of a concealed
firearm), 12031(A) P.C. (Convicted Felon in possession of a loaded firearm), 12316(b)(1) P.C.
(Convicted Felon in possession of ammunition), and 148(a)(1) P.C. (Resisting arrest).

Officer Deguzman advised me Grant vomited and was injured during his arrest. Grant
complained of pain in his back, the left side of his head, and his left knee. He had an abrasion on
his left knee and was limping. Officer Ruff photographed Grant's injuries, and Officer Deguzman
transported Grant to San Leandro Hospital for treatment. | followed him there and epee of

Grant at the hospital. A %s

lread Grant his rights per Miranda, and he decided to give me a statement. Grant stated he was
a passenger in his friend's vehicle earlier when | pulled them over. Grant admitted to having a
loaded pistol in his left front pant pocket and claimed ownership of the pistol. Grant then stated
he wanted to wait for his tawyer, so | ended the interview. See Grant's statement attached.

Grant was treated and cleared for incarceration by hospital staff. | transported Grant to the SLPD

301\ DEGUZMAN, WARREN, F, 10/15/2006 23:00

| On 101506 about 2107 hours, | was working patrol wearing a San Leandro police uniform and
driving a fully marked police vehicle when | responded as a cover officer for Ofc Hidas at the
Tech Co Gas Station on Washington Ave and Fargo Ave. As | approached southbound on
Washington Ave near the intersection of Fargo Ave, | immediately noticed two persons begin to
run. | then recognized Ofc Hidas chasing after a black male subject, later identified as AR-Oscar
Grant, southbound Washington Ave on the west sidewalk. Ofc Hidas advised on the radio that
he was in a foot pursuit of the subject.

| followed after Grant in my vehicle. Grant continued to run southbound on the west sidewalk
past Big O Tires. | pulled into the Big O Tires parking lot, exited my vehicle and removed my
Taser X-26 from my holster. | then ran southbound, parallel to the west sidewalk, through the Big
O Tires parking lot. | saw Grant stumble and almost fali near the intersection of Lewelling BI at
Washington Ave. At this point, | heard Ofc Hidas yell that Grant was in possession of a gun. |
continued ‘to run southbound after Grant from his blind side, on his right, across Lewelling BI. As
| got within the taser's 21 FT shooting range, | pointed the red laser dot at Grant's rear center
body mass and pulled the trigger. | saw a prong enter Grant's jacket and knew | had hit my mark.
Grant then began to stumble forward as his momentum:carried him. | continued to run forward
as well in order to keep the prong intact. Grant finally collapsed to the ground where he hit his
head on the side of a parked vehicle in the Arco Gas Station just a few feet from the south
sidewalk of Lewelling Bi. When Grant collided with the parked vehicle, | saw a small black object
fly into the air over the parked vehicle. When Grant tried crawling underneath the parked vehicle
where | could not see his hands, | continued to depress the taser trigger. After Grant continued
to resist, | executed a right foot strike to the right side of Grant's ribs and ordered Grant to show
me his hands. Grant finally cooperated and placed his right hand to his side. Ofe Hidas
managed to get control of Grant's left hand. | then detained Grant in handcuffs.

M<-APAArZsz

After detaining Grant, | looked over the parked car and saw a smal! black handgun laying on the
ground. | advised Ofc Hidas of it's location. Ofc Hidas retrieved the handgun and placed it on
the hood of the parked vehicle. He then retrieved my vehicle and parked it in the Arco Gas
Station. | then removed the taser prong off of Grant's jacket and placed Grant in the back of my
patrol vehicle. | then secured the handgun inside the trunk of my vehicle.

When Tech Ofc Ruff arrived on scene. | advised him of Grant's gun inside the trunk of my
vehicle. Ofc Ruff then took custody of the weapon and rendered the weapon safe. See Ofc
Ruff's tech report for more details.

{then transported Grant to the San Leandro Hospital for medical clearance since he had injured -
himself during the foot pursuit as well as having been tased.

| collected the spent taser cartridge with the prongs and wires and submitted all into property as
evidence.

See Ofc Hidas' report for more details.
