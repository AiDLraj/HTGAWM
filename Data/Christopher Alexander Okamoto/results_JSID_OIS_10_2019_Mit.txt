SUBJECT: Officer Involved Shooting of Christopher Deandre Mitchell
J.S.LD. File #18-0502
Torrance Police Department File #180058356

DATE: October 9, 2019

The Justice System Integrity Division of the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office has
completed its review of the December 9, 2018, fatal shooting of Christopher Deandre Mitchell by
Torrance Police Department (TPD) Officers Anthony Chavez and Matthew Concannon. We have
concluded that both officers acted in lawful self-defense.

The District Attorney’s Command Center was notified of the shooting at approximately 10:57 p.m.,
on December 9, 2018. The District Attorney Response Team (DART) responded to the location,
and was given a briefing regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting and a walk-through
of the scene.

The following analysis is based on investigative reports, audio recordings, transcripts of interviews,
firearm analysis reports, the autopsy report, crime scene diagrams and sketches, photographic and
video evidence, and witness statements submitted by Torrance Police Department Detective Nate
Tsuhako. Compelled statements were not considered as part of this analysis.

FACTUAL ANALYSIS

On December 9, 2018 at approximately 7:40 p.m., TPD Communications Division received a
9-1-1 call from Dante J and Kerri ] (EP spouse). [J and J advised that
they were following J stolen vehicle, a black Honda Civic with license plate #].
Based on the location provided by J (Carson Street and Denker Avenue), the dispatcher
advised J that they were in the jurisdiction of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).
The dispatcher transferred the call to LAPD, but the call went to an audio recording. The
dispatcher tried a second time to transfer the call, but at some point the call was disconnected.
At approximately 7:53 p.m., JJ flagged down TPD Officers Christopher Allen- Young and
Officer Alex Gonzales on 220" Street west of Western Avenue in Torrance.' [J told the
officers that his vehicle had been stolen and he saw it being driven in the area. J provided a
description of the vehicle as a black 2000 model Honda Civic, with a license plate containing the
numbers “884,” and one nonfunctioning headlight. Jj could not describe who was in the
vehicle. He indicated that he last saw the car traveling westbound on 220" Street then
northbound on Abalone Avenue. [J stated that the time delay between seeing his Honda and
flagging down the officers was less than a minute. Gonzales broadcasted the information
provided by J to TPD Communications at 7:54 p.m.

At approximately 7:54 p.m., the stolen Honda entered the Ralph’s parking lot at 1770 West
Carson Street in Torrance. The driver, later identified as Christopher Deandre Mitchell, drove
east through the lot. As captured by store’s surveillance video, Mitchell then made a left turn
and proceeded north in the lane furthest east in the front of the store. At approximately 7:55
p.m., Mitchell turned head-first into a parking stall and turned off the headlights. No one exited
or entered the Honda in the interval preceding the arrival of police.

Concannon and Chavez were in the area and heard Gonzales’ radio broadcast about the stolen
Honda. They drove north on Abalone Avenue approaching Carson Street in search of the
Honda. Thinking that the driver might have ducked into a parking lot to avoid being observed,
they made a right turn into the Ralph’s parking lot. Ralph’s surveillance video showed
Concannon and Chavez’s unit enter the lot at 7:57 p.m. After the officers drove up and down the
parking lot, Chavez caught sight of a parked Honda matching the description of the stolen
vehicle and told Concannon what he had observed. As they passed the spot where the Honda
was parked, Concannon made a U-turn, drove back to that spot, and parked directly behind the
Honda, blocking it into the parking stall.

Chavez attempted to run the Honda’s license plate on his vehicle computer, but was unable to
complete the search before the officers stopped. The officers exited their vehicle to conduct an
assessment.” The Honda’s engine was not running and the vehicle lights were off. The officers
could not initially tell whether the vehicle was occupied.

At approximately 7:58 p.m., Chavez approached the Honda on the passenger side and looked
through the rear passenger window. Concannon approached on the driver’s side. As they
approached the Honda, the officers realized that the two front windows were closed. The two
rear windows were down slightly. All of the windows, except for the front windshield, were
tinted.

Chavez could see Mitchell seated in the driver’s seat. Chavez yelled, “Police!” and told Mitchell
to put his hands on the steering wheel. Initially, Mitchell sat motionless but then moved his
hands to the steering wheel as directed. Chavez advised Concannon that the vehicle was

miles.

occupied and that the driver had tattoos on his face. While Mitchell was looking towards
Chavez, Concannon opened the driver’s door utilizing the exterior handle. Concannon pushed
the door to the furthest most open position which allowed for better illumination of the cabin.*
Concannon activated his body worn video while at the driver’s door.°

Concannon began to speak with Mitchell, asking him, “What are you doing here, man?”
Mitchell’s hands came off the steering wheel and towards his lap. At this point, Concannon
followed the movement of Mitchell’s hands toward his lap and saw what Concannon believed
was a firearm.® Concannon drew his service weapon and said, “Don’t move! Don’t move!” In
response, Mitchell raised his hands back up to shoulder level.” Mitchell looked at Concannon,
apologized twice,® and again moved his hands down towards the weapon. Concannon put away
his flashlight and switched to a two-handed firing posture. Concannon told Mitchell, “Get out of
the car!”

In the body worn footage, Concannon appeared to move slightly back along the side of the car as
he put away his flashlight. Concannon’s left hand can be seen coming up to brace his firing hand
on the service weapon. After the shift to a two-handed firing position, the body worn camera’s
view of Mitchell was obstructed by Concannon’s hands. As a result, Mitchell is not visible on
the body worn footage during the three seconds preceding the first shot. Concannon can be
heard on the video repeating the command, “Get out of the car!” more forcefully during this
interval. About one second after repeating that command, the first shot was fired.!°

Both officers afterwards described seeing a firearm between Mitchell’s legs and his legs pinched
together in what appeared to be an effort to conceal the weapon. Chavez indicated that he saw a
gun when Mitchell’s hands went up in response to Concannon. Per Chavez, Mitchell then leaned
forward and moved his hands back down. Concannon stated that Mitchell actually touched the
weapon. Concannon later indicated that he was most fearful that Mitchell would shoot Chavez,
as it would have been easier for Mitchell to make that shot. Mitchell also had a black garment
bag draped across his legs that may have concealed the weapon (or a portion of the weapon).
Concannon thought that the garment bag was a floor mat; its position on Mitchell’s lap caused
Concannon to believe that the firearm had just been retrieved. In his interview, Concannon

3 In his voluntary statement, Chavez relayed that he was mindful that shootings involving area gangs had recently
increased. Gangs claimed territory less than a block away. Mitchell’s facial tattoos were documented during his
autopsy. The tattoos include the word “Rebellious” written in cursive above his right eyebrow; three dots below his
right eye (forming a triangle); the name “Sherylyn” in cursive along the right jawline; and the letters PLS arranged
vertically on his left outer cheek.

8 Concannon interpreted Mitchell’s apology as an apology for something he was about to do, e.g., to shoot the
officer, because it seemed like Mitchell was stalling and did not modify his behavior.

° Concannon explained that as Mitchell had failed to follow instructions Concannon gave a different order to see if
he could get Mitchell to remove himself from the firearm.

stated that Mitchell complied with neither the order “Don’t move!” nor the order “Get out of the
car!”

In response to seeing Mitchell’s hands move toward his lap, Concannon fired one round from his
service weapon. Chavez stated that he was in the process of drawing his weapon when he heard
a shot fired. Chavez did not know initially who fired the first shot; he thought it might either be
Mitchell or Concannon. An instant later, Chavez fired two rounds from his service weapon in
rapid succession. Both officers returned to their police vehicle for cover and concealment while
waiting for reinforcement. At approximately 7:58:21 p.m., Chavez broadcast that an officer
involved shooting (OIS) had occurred.

Additional TPD officers arrived. Audio on Concannon’s body camera captured him saying, “It’s
a long gun” to clarify a broadcast made by another officer about “a suspect armed with a
handgun.”!! Numerous commands were made for Mitchell to exit the Honda but without
compliance. A drone was deployed in an effort to obtain visibility inside the vehicle; however,
window tint obstructed this effort. Under command supervision, two 40mm kinetic energy
projectile rounds were fired in an attempt to break the front passenger window to gain visibility,
but these rounds had minimal effect. Officers Eric Bernier, Blake Williams, Joshua Satterfield
and Mark Cuny then approached the passenger’s side of the Honda and forcibly removed the
passenger side window utilizing a “haligan.”!”

With the tinted window out of the way, officers gained clear visibility into the vehicle cabin.
Mitchell was still in the driver’s seat and was observed to be unresponsive. Bernier, Alonso,

'! Approximately one minute 25 seconds after the shooting, Concannon can be heard calling out to Mitchell, “Hey
my man if you can hear me you need to get out and lay on the ground where we can see you. You got to do this so
we can get you some help.” Concannon can be subsequently heard communicating to other officers who had arrived
on scene, “His hands were on it, so watch yourself” and “He’s in the driver’s seat with a gun between his legs.”

Cuny, Williams, and Satterfield approached the Honda under cover of a ballistic shield on the
driver’s side. Mitchell remained unresponsive in the driver’s seat of the car with the weapon still
on his lap. Cuny removed the weapon from Mitchell’s lap and passed it to Satterfield. The
weapon was a black .177 caliber Crosman Phantom Break Barrel Air Rifle from which the
buttstock had been removed but with the grip left in place. See Figure 2 below.

Mitchell was extracted from the vehicle. A TPD officer commenced CPR. Torrance Fire
Department (TFD) personnel who had staged at the location moved in quickly to render aid once
the scene was secured. Mitchell was pronounced deceased at the scene by TFD.

Following the December 10, 2018 investigation of the shooting, Senior Forensic Identification
Specialist Carrie Harris transported all of the evidence to the Torrance Police Station where it
was further processed and booked. The Crosman Air Rifle recovered from Mitchell’s lap is
manufactured with a shoulder-style butt stock. It appears that Mitchell’s rifle had been modified
by removing the butt stock and leaving the grip. In addition to the air rifle that was recovered
from between Mitchell’s legs, a clear plastic bag containing air rifle pellets was found resting in
the driver’s door handle. A key ring recovered from the car contained a shaved key that was
inserted in the ignition.

Three expended .45 caliber shell casings were found near the Honda. These casings matched the
caliber of department-issued weapons used by TPD officers. The first casing was found in the
planter southeast of the vehicle. The second was found on the pavement near the front
passenger-side tire of the Honda Civic. The third shell casing was found on the roof of the
Honda Civic. All three casings were recovered in the immediate vicinity of where the shots were
fired.

The rifle was swabbed for DNA, as was the plastic bag containing pellets that was found in the
door handle. Lab analyses from these samples strongly indicate the presence of Mitchell’s DNA.
LASD Scientific Services Bureau’s analysis determined that there were three contributors to the
mixture of DNA found on the baggie. The criminalist’s statistical projection from the analysis
meaningfully supports the proposition that Mitchell was one of the three DNA contributors.

Five contributors were found to be present on the rifle and LASD accordingly deemed the
sample unsuitable for interpretation by its own laboratory. The sample was submitted to
Cybergenetics (a private laboratory) for additional testing utilizing the TrueAllele Casework
system. Based on work done by TrueAllele Analysts, a statistical projection was derived that
meaningfully supports the proposition that Mitchell was one of the five contributors for the DNA
found on the rifle.
An autopsy was conducted on December 14, 2018 by Associate Deputy Medical Examiner Zuhha
Ashraf. Dr. Ashraf determined that the cause of death was gunshot wounds. The first wound
observed was caused by a gunshot penetrating the right posterior shoulder back to front, right to left,
and downward; exiting the right upper arm before re-entering the right upper torso; then exiting
again on the right upper torso; and grazing the right mid-torso. The second observed wound was
caused by a gunshot entering the left upper back traveling back to front, left to right, and downward
and perforating the ribs, the left lung, the heart, stomach, and liver. While Dr. Ashraf’s report did
not identify this particular wound as fatal, his description of the various associated traumas along
the wound path connotes lethality. The third observed wound was caused by a gunshot entering the
posterior neck traveling back to front, left to right, and downward, exiting the right anterior neck
one and one-half inches above the right clavicle. The fourth observed wound resulted from a
gunshot penetrating the left hand traveling left to right; this shot fractured the thumb.

The evidence suggests that three rounds were fired, which caused four gunshot wounds. Three shell
casings were found at the scene which is consistent with the round count from the officers’
recovered service weapons, and the audible shots heard on Concannon’s body camera. It seems
probable that the wound to Mitchell’s hand resulted from a bullet re-entry.

LEGAL ANALYSIS

California law permits the use of deadly force in self-defense or in the defense of others if the
person claiming the right actually and reasonably believed that he or others were in imminent
danger of great bodily injury or death. Penal Code § 197; People v. Randle (2005) 35 Cal.4" 987,
994 (overruled on another ground in People v. Chun (2009) 45 Cal.4" 1172, 1201); People v.
Humphrey (1996) 13 Cal.4" 1073, 1082; see also, CALCRIM No. 505. In evaluating whether a
police officer’s use of force was reasonable, it is helpful to draw guidance from the objective
standard of reasonableness adopted in civil actions alleging Fourth Amendment violations: “The
‘reasonableness’ of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable
officer on the scene, rather than the 20/20 vision of hindsight. ... The calculus of reasonableness
must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second
judgments — in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving — about the amount of
force that is necessary in a particular situation.” Graham v. Connor (1989) 490 U.S. 386, 396-397.

A police officer may use reasonable force to effect an arrest, prevent escape, or overcome
resistance of a person the officer believes has committed a crime. Penal Code § 835a. An
officer “may use all the force that appears to him to be necessary to overcome all resistance, even
to the taking of life; [an officer is justified in taking a life if] the resistance [is] such as appears to
the officer likely to inflict great bodily injury upon himself or those acting with him.” People v.
Mehserle (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1146. A killing of a suspect by a law enforcement
officer is lawful if it was: (1) committed while performing a legal duty; (2) the killing was
necessary to accomplish that duty; and (3) the officer had probable cause to believe that (a) the
decedent posed a threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others, or (b) that the decedent
had committed a forcible and atrocious crime. CALCRIM No. 507, Penal Code § 196. A
forcible and atrocious crime is one which threatens death or serious bodily harm. Kortum v.
Alkire (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 325, 333.
In protecting oneself or another, a person may use all the force which that person believes
reasonably necessary and that would appear to a reasonable person, in the same or similar
circumstances, to be necessary to prevent the injury which appears to be imminent. CALCRIM No.
3470. Ifthe person’s beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have actually existed. Id.

An officer has “probable cause” in this context when he knows facts which would “persuade
someone of reasonable caution that the other person is going to cause serious physical harm to
another.” CALCRIM No. 507. When acting under Penal Code § 196, the officer may use only
so much force as a reasonable person would find necessary under the circumstances. People v.
Mehserle (2012) 206 Cal.App.4th 1125, 1147. The officer may only resort to deadly force when
the resistance of the person being taken into custody “appears to the officer likely to inflict great
bodily injury on himself or those acting with him.” Jd. at 1146; quoting People v. Bond (1910)
13 Cal.App. 175, 189-190. The prosecution has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable
doubt that a killing was not justified. CALCRIM Nos. 505, 507. As noted by one California
appellate opinion, “[w]here the peril is swift and imminent and the necessity for action immediate,
the law does not weigh in too nice scales the conduct of the assailed and say he shall not be justified
in killing because he might have resorted to other means to secure his safety.” People v. Collins
(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 575, 589.

The evidence examined in this investigation shows that Mitchell was driving a stolen car. He was
about to be detained for investigation of a possible grand theft auto. As the responding officers
approached, they observed what they reasonably perceived to be a firearm in Mitchell’s lap.
Mitchell made movements toward the weapon. This shooting was the type of situation described by
the Graham court when it spoke about officers being forced to make “split-second judgments”
under tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving circumstances. Although the weapon was later
determined to be an air rifle, the officers’ belief that the weapon was a firearm was reasonable under
the circumstances.

A number of observations contributed to the officers’ reasonable fear of suffering death or great
bodily injury. The tattoos on Mitchell’s face made Chavez wary that Mitchell was a gang member.
At least one of the officers (Chavez) indicated that he was mindful of recent gang shootings in the
area. Mitchell was not following instructions. Despite commands not to move (given to Mitchell
after Concannon observed the weapon), followed by repeated commands to get out of the car,
Mitchell followed neither of these instructions and instead lowered his hands toward an object that
the officers reasonably believed was a deadly weapon. Reasonably fearing for his and his partner’s
lives, Concannon fired an initial shot from his service weapon. An instant later, Chavez fired twice
from the other side of the car.

Based on Mitchell’s failure to follow the officers’ directions, his continued efforts to conceal the
object in his lap, the physical appearance of the object, and the movement of his hands toward the
object, it was reasonable for the officers to believe that the object was a firearm and to respond with
deadly force. Accordingly, both officers’ use of deadly force was reasonable under the
circumstances.
CONCLUSION

We find that Officers Anthony Chavez and Matthew Concannon acted lawfully in self-defense
when they used deadly force against Christopher Deandre Mitchell. We are closing our file and will
take no further action in this matter.
