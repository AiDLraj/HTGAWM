NARRATIVE

18-09733

On 10-3-2018, Sergeant Weidner, Deputy Wang, Deputy Lorenzatti, Deputy Watt and Deputy
DeMartini were involved in a critical incident during a contact with Suspect Chinedu Okobi (DOB: 2-
13-1982). This incident began at approximately 1301 hours on El Camino Real at the intersection with
Millwood Drive. After a physical altercation, in which Deputy Wang was assaulted by Okobi, Okobi
was eventually detained in handcuffs. Sometime after Okobi was secured, he suffered some type of
medical emergency. Okobi was transported by ambulance to Mills-Peninsula Medical Center (1501
Trousdale Drive in Burlingame) where he was later pronounced deceased. Deputy Wang was also
transported by ambulance to Mills-Peninsula Medical Center where he received medical treatment for
injuries he sustained during the altercation.

The details of this incident, including the actions of Sheriffs Office personnel and the actions of the
suspect, are being investigated by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Inspectors Office per the
counties critical incident protocol. The Inspector’s Office case number is #18-1003-02.
POTENTIAL LEADS/RECOMMENDATIONS:

Case to be forwarded to the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Inspectors Office for information.

SUPPLEMENT 1 : 18-09733

Addendum:

On Wednesday, October 3, 2018 approximately 1330 hours, I was assigned to assist the San Mateo
County Sheriff’s Millbrae Bureau for calls of service due to a “Critical Incident” that had occurred
approximately 1304 hours.

Approximately 1720 hours, I was in the parking lot of the Millbrae Bureau located at 581 Magnolia
Avenue, City of Millbrae, County of San Mateo talking to Deputy Richard Isla who secured his patrol
equipment in the front seat of a marked Sheriff’s Patrol Vehicle # 16.

As a general practice, I check the prisoner compartment (rear seat) of the patrol car to insure no
contraband, weapons, or personal property has been placed there by a detained suspect(s), transported
prisoner(s) or a deputy. While doing so, I discovered two duffle bags and a brown paper bag that had a
handwritten name tag attached with the name of Okobi, Chinedu Valentine. I removed the items from
the patrol vehicle, apprised Sergeant Szerenyi, who escorted me to the Armory Room, which is located
inside the Millbrae Bureau. I placed the items on the floor, and Sergeant Szerenyi secured the Amory
Room.

Additional Information / Recommendations:

Forward addendum to the Sheriff's Detective Bureau or Inspector(s) from the San Mateo County District
Attorney’s Office-Bureau of Investigation for their perusal.

INVESTIGATIVE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT #4:

On 10-3-2018, at approximately 1335 hours, I was advised that San Mateo County Sheriff's Office
personnel had been involved in a critical incident and at least one Deputy Sheriff and the suspect were
being or had been transported to Mills-Peninsula Medical Center for treatment. I further learned that the
suspect had some type of medical emergency during or shortly after the incident. ,

At approximately 1352 hours, I made contact with Deputy Javier Acosta, whom I had been told followed
the suspect’s ambulance to the hospital. I inquired about the status of the suspect and was informed by
Deputy Acosta that it appeared the suspect was not going to.survive his medical emergency. I advised
Deputy Acosta that I would meet with him at the hospital.

I briefed Lieutenant Dal Porto about the situation and it was decided that he and I would respond to the
hospital to further investigate. I also learned Sheriff’s Office Detectives and Inspectors from the District
Attorney’s Office were responding to the scene and the hospital to investigate.

At approximately 1420 hours, while en route to the hospital, I received a call from Deputy Acosta who
informed me the suspect had been pronounced deceased at approximately 1417 hours.

At approximately 1440 hours, Lieutenant Dal Porto and I arrived at the hospital and made contact with
Detectives Carroll and Chaghouri outside emergency room #2. Detectives Carroll and Chaghouri were
standing by with the body of the deceased suspect, which was located on the hospital bed and covered by
a white sheet. Detective Chaghouri informed me that Deputy Wang was being treated inside emergency
room #18 for injuries he sustained during the altercation.

I spoke with Deputy Acosta and asked if the suspect had been identified. Deputy Acosta told me the

suspect had been identified as Chinedu Ck: as While I was observing Okobi’s body,
a nurse entered then room and used a scale built into the bed to weigh Okobi. The scale showed his

weight to be 337 Ibs.

The San Mateo County Critical Incident Protocol was activated and followed as a result of this incident.
All further investigation and follow up into the events of this incident will be conducted and
documented by the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Inspectors Office. Their case number for this
incident is 18-1003-02.

During the investigation into this incident, the DA Inspectors collected the uniforms, duty pistols, duty
belts, gear, Taser’s and other miscellaneous items from the involved Sheriff's Office personnel.

The District Attorney’s Inspectors conducted their interviews with the involved personnel and their
respective representatives on 10-4-2018 and 10-5-2018. After the interviews were completed, Senior
Inspector Bill Massey returned the majority of property to me that had been collected from the involved
personnel on 10-3-2018. The following is a list of the items returned to me:

End of property description

During a review of the above listed property, it was discovered that Sergeant Weidner’s outer ballistic
vest carrier had a dark reddish-brown substance on it that appeared to be blood. The apparent blood was
located on the utility pouch that contained his secondary weapon (right breast side next to magazine
holders). I took digital photographs of the apparent blood and Sergeant Weidner’s vest carrier was
retained as evidence (item #30).

I examined all of the above listed returned property for further evidence related to the incident. I also
took digital photographs of all of the returned property. Those photographs were later downloaded onto

AWARENESS:

On October 3, 2018 at approximately 1301 hours, I was on duty as a patrol supervisor for the San Mateo
County Sheriff's Office Transit Police Bureau. I was in a fully marked patrol vehicle conducting a
station check of the San Bruno Caltrain Station. I heard a broadcast over the police channel of a deputy
in Millbrae requesting assistance. Deputies Padro Miqueo and Javier Acosta (assigned to the Transit
Police Bureau) were conducting the station check with me at the time of the request for assistance. I

. authorized the deputies to respond to the location (El Camino and Millwood Drive in Millbrae) Code 3.

I also responded to the location with my vehicle’s lights and sirens activated.
SUMMARY:

Upon arrival on scene, I exited my patrol vehicle and observed a black male adult was in a seated
position the middle of El Camino Real. The subject’s hands were restrained behind his back and two
deputies were keeping the subject upright by standing behind him and using their knees to support him
in his seated position. They were using their hand to hold the subject’s shoulders/ upper body. The
subject was not struggling nor were the deputies exerting force / pressure in keeping the subject in his
position. I observed Deputy Acosta run up and replace one of the two deputies who were assisting the
subject in sitting up. The subject was breathing at the time of my initial observation due to the fact that
his chest and upper body were moving as he inhaled and exhaled heavy breaths.

lalso noted that Sergeant Weidner was directing northbound traffic on El Camino Real. The
northbound number 1 and 2 lanes had been blocked off by patrol vehicles and other government
vehicles. The number 3 was open and vehicles were slowly passing by. Sergeant Weidner was standing
approximately 10 feet away from the detained subject, directing traffic. I replaced the sergeant and took
over traffic control. ;] knew that the ambulance and additional fire personnel were stuck in the
northbound traffic and I wanted to relieve some of the congestion so they could make their way up to our
location. Shortly after I took over, an American Medical Response ambulance arrived and I stopped all
other vehicle traffic from proceeding through in both directions of El Camino Real from Millwood
Drive to Santa Helena. San Bruno Police arrived on scene and I directed them to close off that section
and assume traffic control.

I directed Deputy Acosta to cordon off the area with police tape. I also directed Deputy Miqueo to
began identifying and obtaining potential witness information. I observed several subjects were standing
on both sides of El Camino Real watching / video recording this incident. I assisted Deputy Acosta and
Sheriff? s Office CSO Joseph Gonzales in placing crime scene tape on both sidewalks of El Camino Real
(West and East) and across El Camino Real at Capuchino Drive and San Juan Avenue.

I walked back to the area in where the subject was receiving medical attention and heard on of the fire
fighters say that the subject was not breathing. I directed Deputy Lorenzatti to remove the metal
handcuffs from the subject, which she did, and the subject was placed on his back. The Fire Department
and AMR promptly began CPR. During this time, I requested that the Sheriff’s Office Detective Bureau
be notified of this incident and requested them to respond to the scene. The subject was transported to
Peninsula Hospital by AMR. I requested that the detectives be notified of the subject’s updated location
and have a few of them diverted to the hospital.

400 COUNTY CENTER REDWOOD CITY, CA 94063 650-216-7676
: SUPPLEMENT 6 18-09733

I assisted in locating potential witnesses. I contacted two employees at the front counter of Dr. Ankur
Parikh DDS, 1490 El Camino Real. The subjects told me that they had witnessed a portion of the
incident. I obtained their contact information and later it was provided to the San Mateo County District
Attorney’s Office as a part of their investigation. I also contacted the manager of Tri Counties Bank. I
had observed an ATM was affixed to the bank’s exterior facing El Camino Real. I knew that a part of
the contact that the deputies had with the subject was in front of the bank because of the subject’s
belongings (backpacks and other small items) were sitting on the sidewalk in front of the ATM. I filled
out a request form to have the video footage from the ATM’s security camera be saved and a copy of the
security footage be provided to us. I know from previous experiences that video security footage can
sometimes be deleted or recorded over automatically depending on storage capacities for various
systems. I later informed inspectors from the San Mateo District Attorney’s Office that I had made that
request and the footage would be forwarded to.them.

I was instructed by Captain Kunkel to escort the involved Sheriff’s Office personnel from the scene back
to the Millbrae substation. At the substation, I monitored the personnel and made sure that they did not
clean themselves or their uniform / police equipment. I took digital photographs of Sergeant David
Weidner, Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti, Deputy John Demartini, and Deputy Bryan Watt. I later transferred
those digital images onto a CD and booked the CD into evidence. The involved personnel were taken to
a local hotel and I remained with them until a Inspector from the San Mateo County District Attorney’s
Office arrived.

EVIDENCE:

On 10/03/2018, at approximately 1301 hours, Deputy J. Acosta and I responded to a call of code 3 cover
to the city of Millbrae. Upon our arrival, I assisted on scene Deputies with securing the scene, taking
photographs and interviewing potential witnesses.

AWARENESS

On 10/03/2018, at approximately 1301 hours, Deputy J. Acosta and I were in full San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office Deputy uniform with visible badge and patches. We were conducting Transit Bureau
related follow-up at the Caltrain Station in the city of San Bruno. During this time we heard radio traffic
from Millbrae Deputies contacting a subject who was walking in and out of traffic along El Camino
Real. The Deputies broadcasted that the subject was tased, but continued to resist. We heard the Deputy
broadcast that the subject was tased a second time and the call for code 3 cover was requested. Sergeant
Weidner then broadcasted on the air that Deputies were injured and for additional units to continue code
3 cover.

While still approximately half a block away, Deputy J. Acosta exited the patrol car and ran to assist
Deputies due to our being slowed 'by heavy traffic. Once I arrived on scene, I was immediately
instructed by Sergeant Weidner to begin to photograph the scene and all individuals involved in the
incident.

After taking photographs of the scene, I was instructed by Sergeant Zaidi to canvass the area for
potential witnesses and contacted Robert Wesley Garrison. Witness Garrison told me he had recorded
most of the incident from inside the bank and would cooperate with law enforcement so that we may
obtain a copy of the video. Witness Garrison said he had to go so I took down his contact information
and told him either a Detective form the Sheriff's Office, or an Inspector form the District Attorney’s
Office would contact him shortly.

After canvassing for witnesses, I received statements from Deputy DeMartini which were hand written
on paper and to be turned over to the District Attorney’s Office once their personnel arrived on scene.
Once the District Attorney Inspector arrived on scene, I turned over Deputy DeMartini’s written
statements. [| remained on the outer perimeter of the incident to prevent unauthorized persons form
entering the area until I was properly relieved by Deputy M. Sanders.

STATEMENTS
Statement of Witness Robert Wesley Garrison (Not Recorded/Not Verbatim)
Witness Garrison told me that he was inside the bank when the incident started. He began to record it

with his phone through the windows from inside the bank. He also stated he would cooperate with law
enforcement so that we may obtain a copy of the video.

Incident. This report is for documentation purposes only.

      
  

Investigation:

 
   

On Wednesday, 10/03/18, at approximately 1445 hours, I received a request to contact DA Senior
Inspector Bill Massey in order to assist in an Officer Involved Critical Incident. | contacted Massey and
responded to El Camino Real and Millwood, Millbrae, where I met with Massey. Massey informed me
San Mateo County Deputies were involved in an altercation with a subject (decedent), in which a Taser
was deployed. Massey informed me the decedent was currently at Mills Peninsula Medical Center
(Mills) and asked me to respond there.

At approximately 1530 hours, I arrived at Mills and met with San Mateo County Detectives Gaby
Chaghouri and John Carrol, who were standing by in a trauma room with the decedent. They informed
me the decedent had been pronounced deceased at 1417 hours by Dr. Bryant.

I relieved Detectives Chaghouri and Carrol and stood by with the decedent. At approximately 1542
hours, Deputy Coroner Heather Diaz arrived on scene. Diaz took multiple photographs, did a
preliminary exam of the decedent, and inventoried the decedent's property. Diaz provided me with a
receipt for the decedent's property. which I later provided to DA Inspector Draper. At approximately
1736 hours, Diaz left Mills with the decedent.

 

| responded to the San Bruno Fire Department, located at 555 El Camino Real, San Bruno, and met with
Fire Captain Sean Brube of Engine #51. Brube provided me the following statement in summary,
regarding his response to the incident scene:

Statement of Sean Brube, summarized and audio taped:

Brube said he responded to a medical aid on El Camino Real near Cappuccino at the request of Engine #
37. Upon arrival, they were notified by the Captain of Engine #37 that there was one patient in full
arrest. Brube and his firefighters began assisting in providing CPR. Brube personally helped provide
ventilations to the decedent and watched over his intern. Once the ambulance arrived, Brube rode in the
ambulance, continuing to provide care. Once at the hospital, the decedent's care was turned over to
hospital staff.

While on scene on El Camino Real, Brube heard from police personnel and the Captain of Engine #37
that the decedent had been "tased" and possibly pepper-sprayed multiple times. Brube said the decedent
still had one of the Taser prongs in him.

This concluded Brube's statement

I then spoke with Firefighter Paramedic Jeremy Whiteaker, who provided the following statement in

On Wednesday, 10/03/2018, Detective Scholes and I responded to the area of El Camino Real (SR-82)
and Millwood Drive, in Millbrae, to assist the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office
Investigations Bureau with an Officer-Involved Critical Incident. This report is for documentation
purposes only and in regard to San Mateo County District Attorney's Office case #18-1003-02.

INVESTIGATION:

On Wednesday, 10/03/2018, at approximately 1515 hours, I was asked to respond to the area of El
Camino Real (SR-82) and Millwood Drive in Millbrae to assist the San Mateo County District
Attorney's Office Investigations Bureau with an Officer-Involved Critical Incident. I was instructed to
respond to the above location and meet with Senior Inspector Bill Massey.

At approximately 1540 hours, I arrived on scene and met with Senior Inspector Massey. He provided
me a brief summary of the events that unfolded which led to their response. I learned several San Mateo
County Deputies were involved in a violent altercation with a subject, who will be referred as the
decedent for the remainder of this supplemental report. Further, the Deputies utilized their tasers and
"OC spray" (oleoresin capsicum) during their attempts to take the decedent in to custody. After the
decedent was successfully detained in handcuffs, cardiac arrest was witnessed in the decedent by the
medical personnel. The decedent was subsequently transported to Mills Peninsula Hospital, in
Burlingame, where he was pronounced dead.

Senior Inspector Massey informed me there was a large response of medical personnel to the scene that
included various Fire Department and AMR members. Senior Inspector Massey requested I interview
the involved medical personnel and obtain statements pertaining to their individual actions and
observations while at the scene.

Afterwards, I met with Sergeant Trickett of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. I requested the CAD
history of the medical personnel that responded to the area of El Camino Real (SR-82) and Millwood
Drive in Millbrae. He contacted a member of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office and facilitated my
request of the incident's CAD history. I then responded to 581 Magnolia Avenue in Millbrae, which
Sergeant Trickett said was a San Mateo County Sheriffs Office sub-station.

After I received the CAD history, I learned the following medical personnel responded to the scene:

e Fire Engine #37 of the Central San Mateo County Fire Department. Their station was located at
511 Magnolia Avenue, in Millbrae.

e Fire Engine #51 of the San Bruno Fire Department. Their station was located at 555 El Camino
Real, in San Bruno.

e AMR (American Medical Response) unit numbers 37 and 94. Both unit numbers were based out

SUPPLEMENT 1 - Response to Incident Command Post 18007134

of the main San Mateo County AMR headquarters, which was located at 1510 Rollins Road, in
Burlingame.

Due to my close proximity to Fire Engine #37 (511 Magnolia Avenue), I elected to respond there first.
At approximately 1630 hours, | arrived on scene and met with Fire Captain Donnelly of the Central
County Fire Department. I asked him if | could speak with all of the members of his station that had
responded to the critical incident noted above. He informed me I could and designated a private briefing
room in the station in order to do so. He asked if I wished to speak with all of the members together or
individually, and I told him individually in order to preserve the integrity of their subjective
observations.

I first spoke with Captain Donnelly. He informed me he was a Fire Captain with Engine #37, which was
a part of the Central San Mateo County Fire Department. He then provided me with the following
statement in summary.

The following statement of Donnelly, summarized and audio recorded:

Donnelly told me Engine #37 was dispatched on a medical call and they were given instructions to stage
nearby until the scene was deemed secure. He said they did not have a lot of information on the initial
dispatched call; however, he remembers the dispatcher saying the "the patient" (decedent) had been
tased. Donnelly said he was accompanied by two "professional firefighters" who were considered
firefighter paramedics, one firefighter-intern, and that he himself was a firefighter-EMT.

Donnelly said they were instructed to stage at E] Camino Real (SR-82) and Santa Helena Avenue. He
said they were unable to reach their designated staging point due to the traffic congestion on E] Camino
Real from the law enforcement-related incident. He said they then elected to park at El Camino Real
and Millwood Drive.

Donnelly said once the scene was deemed secure, they drove slightly forward and parked at El] Camino
Real and Capuchino Drive. He said he told his crew members to "keep their head on a swivel," due to a
lot of law enforcement personnel in the area and the amount of onlookers in the general vicinity. He
said he met with a San Mateo County Sheriffs Office Deputy, but said he did not know his name. He
said the Deputy pointed to the decedent who was detained in handcuffs behind his back. He said the
Deputy told him the decedent had ripped off one of the taser "barbs" (probes) during the altercation and
that the decedent had been tased twice.

Donnelly said the Deputy also told him there were approximately three Deputies that had been exposed
to pepper spray, two of which declined medical attention. He said due to the amount of patients he had
at the scene (the decedent and three Deputies), he immediately requested another fire engine and a
Battalion Chief to respond to his location. He said he then immediately assigned one of his paramedics
to attend to the decedent, and another to attend to the two Deputies that had been exposed to pepper
spray. He said one of the Deputies that appeared to have been exposed to pepper spray, also appeared to
have visible "trauma" on his face.

and Interviews with Fire Dept and AMR Personnel

 

Donnelly said when he arrived on scene, the decedent was seated on his buttocks, in an upright position,
with both of his legs outwards and in front of him. He said the decedent's back was being supported by
a Deputy's legs, who was standing upright and directly behind the decedent. Donnelly said he did not
have any interaction with the decedent personally, so he was unaware if the decedent was talking aloud
or responding to an outside stimulus. Donnelly said he did not see any visible injuries on the decedent
and assumed he was breathing because his paramedic assessed him and did not notify him immediately
of the full arrest.

Donnelly said Engine #51 from the San Bruno Fire Department arrived on scene. He said almost
immediately after they arrived on scene, he learned the decedent had gone in to "full arrest" (cardiac
arrest).

Donnelly said one of the Deputies had blood on his face, which he presumed to be some sort of facial
injury. He said the injury was on the Deputy's left side of his face; however, he was unsure if the injury
was a laceration or abrasion. Donnelly then told me Firefighter Paramedic Mazza, who was assigned to
the injured Deputy, immediately ceased medical aide on the Deputy and attended to the decedent
because he was in "full arrest."

Donnelly said the medical personnel continued to provided life saving measures. He said the decedent
was then loaded up on to an ambulance and transported to the hospital.

End of statement.

After speaking with Donnelly, I then spoke with Firefighter Paramedic Mark Mazza. He informed me
he was assigned to Engine #37, which was a part of the Central San Mateo County Fire Department. He
then provided me with the following statement in summary.

The following statement of Mazza, summarized and audio recorded:

Mazza told me Engine #37 was dispatched on a medical call and were given instructions to stage nearby
until the scene was deemed secure. He said the "PD" (Police Department) requested a Code 3 cover
response (respond with their emergency lights and sirens activated), which was why the scene needed to
be secured before they entered.

Mazza said they staged at El Camino Real (SR-82) and Millwood Drive. He said they were notified the
scene was secure and they then moved closer to the scene near Capuchino Drive. He said after they
parked, he immediately exited, grabbed his medical supplies, and said his Captain (Donnelly) assigned
him to the injured Deputy, Deputy Wang.

 

Mazza said as he walked up to Deputy Wang, he noticed he was leaning on the tailgate of a white pickup
truck to what he assumed was some sort of city vehicle. He said he then looked to his right and at a
distance, he noticed the decedent was in custody and seated on the pavement. He said the decedent was
upright, propped up, and leaning against two Officer's or Deputy's knees and shins. Mazza said the
decedent's legs were directly out in front of him in the shape of a'"V."

Mazza said he was approximately 15 feet away from the decedent and he said he appeared to be
breathing when he initially saw him. Mazza said he knew the decedent was "pepper sprayed," which
was why he saw the snot dripping from his face. Mazza said the snot or mucous dripping from the
decedent's face was moving and that his abdomen appeared to be rising and falling as if he was inhaling
and exhaling.

Mazza said when he initially assessed Deputy Wang, he noticed he appeared to be dazed and that he had
several lacerations to the left side of his face. He said the lacerations were on Deputy Wang's left cheek,
near his left eye, and said there was visible swelling near the injuries. Mazza said he asked Deputy
Wang if he was "hit" and what caused the injury. He said Deputy Wang confirmed with him he was in
fact hit in the face. He said Deputy Wang also said his face was "grabbed" by the decedent. Mazza said
Deputy Wang also complained of pain to his right wrist.

Mazza said he felt the area around Deputy Wang's injuries and said all of the bones felt as if they were
intact. Mazza said he asked Deputy Wang if he had any other injuries and he said that his right wrist
was also injured. He said while speaking with Deputy Wang, he noticed several other Deputies with
their noses running and spitting on the ground. He said he recognized this behavior to be consistent with
being exposed to "OC Spray" (oleoresin capsicum).

 

Mazza said he applied a blood pressure cuff to Deputy Wang, then went to the fire engine to retrieve
sterile waters for the Deputies that were exposed to the "OC Spray." Mazza said as he went back to
Deputy Wang, he noticed the blood pressure cuff was still filling up with air. He said the firefighter
paramedic that was attending to the decedent immediately yelled to him that they needed the blood
pressure machine immediately. Mazza said he looked over and saw the medical personnel had begun
CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) on the decedent.

Mazza said he removed the blood pressure cuff off of Deputy Wang before it was done filling up and
brought it over to the medical personnel that were attending to the decedent. He said he retrieved his
medical supplies and positioned himself near the decedent's head. He said he heard the blood pressure
reader's tone and knew instantly to get emergency drugs. He said they then elected to cut the decedent's
clothes from his body in order to administer an "1.0." (Intraosseous Infusion) to the decedent's shin.
Mazza explained to me an "1.0." was a process used to provide fluids and medications into the bone
marrow when intravenous access is not available or feasible.

Mazza said he handed off the drill and supplies to do an "1.0." to a member of AMR as he disinfected
the site. Mazza said he heard the flatline on the blood pressure machine, so he got the epinephrine
ready. Mazza said he took the decedent's blood sugar levels from his index finger on his left hand and
found it to be 103, which he said was in normal limits.

 

 

Mazza said he did not see any visible injuries to the decedent's front side when he initially saw him.
Mazza said they later rolled the decedent on to a "mega mover," which he said was a large canvass litter
with handles that assists them with moving people from the ground and on to a gurney. He said when
the decedent was lifted on to the gurney, a Police Office Cadet or Trainee removed the handcuffs from

the decedent's wrists. He said when the handcuffs were being removed, he noticed abrasions on the
decedent's outer hands and knuckle areas. Mazza said when he cut away the decedent's pants. he did not
see any injuries to his legs.

End of statement.

After speaking with Mazza, I then spoke with Firefighter Paramedic David Novelli, He informed me he
was assigned to Engine #37, which was a part of the Central San Mateo County Fire Department. He
then provided me with the following statement in summary.

The following statement of Novelli, summarized and audio recorded:

Novelli said he could not remember the specific dispatched call, but remembered the specific
instructions that they were to stage nearby until the scene was deemed secure. He said he felt the initial
call was a "medical aide and to stage out" at El Camino Real and Capuchino Drive.

 

Novelli said while they were en route, he remembered them being updated that there was a taser
deployment. He said the traffic was congested when they arrived and staged a few blocks away. He said
several other police department vehicles arrived on the scene simultaneously with their emergency lights
and sirens activated, which he knew the call was likely a serious in nature. Novelli said he also saw
several officers running to the scene and knew that based off of their actions he suspected an officer was
in need of assistance.

Novelli said after the scene was deemed safe and secure, they drove closer and his Captain told them to
"keep their heads on a swivel." Novelli said Donnelly was talking to an Officer or Deputy and that he
appeared to be trying to ascertain what they had. He said he then noticed the injured Officer, although
he did not know his name.

Novelli said he noticed abrasions to the injured Officer's left side of his face as he was leaning up against
the tailgate of a pickup truck. Novelli said he then looked to his left and saw the decedent was seated
upright and within the #2 lane of northbound El Camino Real (SR-82). He said as he was making his
initial approach, the injured officer was "tracking him" and the decedent's face was down. He said
because of this, he then elected to attend to the decedent first.

Novelli said the decedent was sitting down on his buttocks with his legs and feet directly out in front of
him. Novelli said the decedent was handcuffed behind his back and leaning against two Officer's or
Sheriff Deputy's legs. He said the decedent was not slumped forward and that he was leaning back
against the legs of the Officers.

 

Novelli said the first AMR unit arrived on scene. He said the Paramedic from the AMR unit met him at
the decedent and they both assessed the decedent for his level of alertness. Novelli said the decedent did
not respond, so they both checked for a pulse at the decedent's carotid arteries. Novelli said both he and
the AMR Paramedic agreed they felt a pulse on the decedent. Novelli said as he checked for a pulse, the
decedent shook his head back and forth twice.

Novelli said the scene was chaotic as there were numerous bystanders nearby. He said he and the AMR
Paramedic elected to get the decedent out of the street and into the back of an ambulance. He said the
decedent was very large so the AMR Paramedic went to the ambulance to get a gurney and a "scoop
stretcher." He said by the time the AMR Paramedic got back, they both realized something had changed
in the decedent's appearance so they checked for his pulse again.

Novelli said they checked the decedent's pulse again and said they were unable to feel a pulse in his
carotid area. He said they laid the decedent down, checked for a pulse again per procedure, then
immediately began CPR because they were unable to find a pulse rate. He said he began CPR and then
Engine #51 from the San Bruno Fire Department arrived on scene.

Novelli said the Captain from the San Bruno Fire Department's Engine #51 notified him he had a
Paramedic Intern accompanying him and asked him if he could "run the scene." Novelli said it was
common practice to have an intern take control of the scene to better assess their abilities in the field, get
them as many contacts as possible, and so they can progress through their training.

 

Novelli said he relinquished the scene to the Paramedic Intern from Engine #51 and then continued with
his CPR application. Novelli said both he and the Intern from Engine #37 each took turns with the CPR
application. He said after his first sequence of CPR was done, he went to where the injured Officer was
to get an idea of what had transpired so they could better treat the decedent.

Novelli said the injured Officer (Deputy Wang) told him when he first saw the decedent, the decedent
was walking east on Millwood and against a red light, crossing El Camino, and walking into oncoming
traffic. He said the Officer told him he conducted a u-turn and drove next to the decedent and told him
he needed to talk to him. He said the Officer described the decedent to be "zig-zagging" across all 6
lanes, northbound on El Camino Real.

Novelli said the injured Officer said he deployed his taser and pressed the taser trigger two to three more
times. Novelli said he overheard another Officer may have deployed a taser as well, and that "OC spray"
may have been used as well. He said due to the amount of mucous coming from two of the Officers, he

knew "OC spray" to have been used. Novelli said the two Officers that were exposed to the "OC Spray"
remained with the decedent despite their exposure until they were relieved by medical personnel.

Novelli said they cut off all of the decedent's clothes and did not notice any obvious injuries on his
person. Novelli said he did see a taser probe in the decedent's chest, immediately right of his sternum.
Novelli said he did not want to pull the taser probe out, so he cut around the probe and wire. He said
after the "cut away” was complete, the probe remained in the decedent's chest and there was a small
piece of shirt stuck to the wire and probe as he cut around them. Novelli said during his entire time
around the decedent, the decedent did not make any statements or speak at all.

Novelli said he went to his fire engine to get his suction equipment and by the time he returned, the rest
of the medical personnel were lifting the decedent on to the gurney and putting him in to the back of the
ambulance. Novelli said after the decedent was placed in the back of an ambulance, he was approached

by a San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Sergeant who asked him to attend to his injured Officer
(Deputy).

Novelli said he went to the injured Officer, who was seated in the rear of a patrol vehicle. He said a
Sergeant collected the injured Officer's duty belt, uniform shirt, and vest. Novelli said he then went to
Peninsula Hospital with the injured Officer within AMR unit 94.

Novelli said the injured Officer began to complain of pain to the left side of his face, the right side of his
neck, and his right wrist. He said the injured Officer's face appeared as if it was no longer actively
bleeding, so he decided to establish an I.V. in his arm in the event the hospital would provide him with
pain medications. Novelli said while they were driving to the hospital, the injured Officer mentioned the
decedent was "actively" trying to attack him. Novelli asked the injured Officer if he was struck by a
flailing hand of the decedent to ensure no weapon was used. He said the injured Officer clarified that no
weapon was used; however, he said the decedent was trying to hit him in the face.

Novelli said when they got to the hospital, the injured Officer's injuries did not appear to be "deep"
lacerations. I asked him if they were similar to abrasions and he said he could not say.

End of statement.

After speaking with Novelli, Donnelly informed me the medical personnel from AMR unit 94 were
waiting in the living room of the fire station. I then spoke with EMT Field Training Officer Ferdinand
Retanubun. He informed me he was assigned to AMR unit 94. He then provided me with the following
statement in summary.

The following statement of Retanubun, summarized and audio recorded:

Retanubun said he was driving AMR ambulance 94 in San Mateo on Highway 101 when they overheard
the AMR supervisor requesting an additional AMR unit to the above incident. Retanubun said they
overheard the AMR supervisor ask what the nature of the call was over the radio. He said the medical
dispatcher informed him it was an Officer-involved tasing and pepper spray incident.

Retanubun said they arrived on scene and parked at El Camino Real directly behind AMR unit 37. He
said when he arrived on scene he first noticed a large amount of bystanders with their cell phones
recording the scene. He said he then saw the decedent on the ground, handcuffed behind his back, near a
gurney. He said the decedent appeared to not be motionless when he overheard someone say, "Check to
see if he's breathing."

Retanubun said his AMR unit was assigned to the injured Officer who was bleeding from the face. He
said after they were given their assignment, they took the injured Officer in the back of the ambulance to
render medical aid to his face. He said before they were able to attend to the Officer's face, the injured
Officer elected to retrieve his cell phone from his patrol vehicle. He said he exited the ambulance to
follow the Officer. He said as he was following the Officer, he noticed the other medical personnel were
"working" (applying life saving measures) on the decedent.

Retanubun said he presumed the decedent had gone in to cardiac arrest. He said his partner told him the
Officer was walking around and appeared to be fine in comparison to the decedent, so he went over to
the decedent's location to assist. He said his partner, later identified as Paramedic Pham, stayed with the
injured Officer.

Retanubun said while he was with the decedent, the medical personnel were administering CPR and
providing air to the decedent. He said he noted there were adequate personnel applying aid to the
decedent, so he made himself available in case someone needed relief during the chest compressions.
He said he also saw a female EMT with AMR unit 37 and that he told her she needed to be free
(available) to drive the ambulance to the hospital when they were ready to transport the decedent.

Retanubun said the fire intern from Engine #51 was attempting to intubate (insert a tube in to the
trachea) the decedent. He said he then relieved one of the medical personnel and began administering
CPR to the decedent. Retanubun said while he was administering CPR, the decedent was hooked up to
an ECG machine, and he noted the decedent did not have a pulse. Retanubun said they continued CPR
when one of the paramedics told everyone. "We need to get this guy going."

Retanubun said they put the decedent on to a "mega mover," when he noticed the decedent still had
handcuffs on. He said he saw a Police Cadet nearby who assisted them with the removal of the
handcuffs. Retanubun said after the handcuffs were removed. the decedent was placed on a gurney and
brought to an ambulance.

Retanubun said he was still applying CPR to the decedent, so he elected to go to the hospital with the
decedent. He said the Fire Intern, the Engine #51 Captain, and the Paramedic from AMR unit 37 were
also with him in the back of the ambulance. He said the EMT from 37 was the one driving the
ambulance. He said he then went to the hospital with AMR unit 37. He said medical aid was rendered
to the decedent the entire way to the hospital.

Retanubun said he did not notice any visible injuries on the decedent's chest, with the exception of a
single taser probe that was stuck in the right side of the decedent's chest. He said the taser probe was
within the skin and that there was a small piece of shirt that was around the probe and wire when the
decedent's shirt was cut off.

Retanubun said the injured Officer did not tell him how he sustained his injuries. He said he overheard
there was "a scuffle" and that several Officers were exposed to pepper spray.

End of statement.

After speaking with Retanubun, | then spoke with Paramedic Patrick Pham. He informed me he was
assigned to AMR unit 94 and was Retanubun's partner. He then provided me with the following
statement in summary.

The following statement of Pham, summarized and audio recorded:

Pham said he was the Paramedic assigned to AMR unit 94. Pham said they were dispatched on the
report of a "police request for medical aid," but the information was limited. He said when they arrived
on scene, they overheard there were several patients who had been exposed to pepper spray.

Pham said he was initially tasked with the primary care of two injured Sheriff's Department Deputies.
Pham said he was assigned to an Asian Deputy with abrasions to his face (Deputy Wang) and a bald
Deputy who had been exposed to OC spray. Pham said when he initially saw the injured Deputy, he
noticed a Firefighter was assessing him, so he did not get a good look at him. He said the injuries on the
injured Deputy appeared to be a laceration on the left side of his face, near his eye. He said the
laceration did not appear to be bleeding too bad. He said he also noticed a small abrasion to the
Deputy's right hand.

Pham said the injured Deputy was trying to tell him what had happened; however, due to the amount of
chaos at the scene and people talking over one another, he did not remember his accounts of what had
happened.

Pham said when he arrived at the scene, he noted the decedent was "shirtless" and his chest was
exposed. He said the decedent was being attended to and said the primary Paramedic appeared as if he
was trying to get the decedent to the hospital as fast as possible. Pham said while he was still attending
to the Officers, he overheard somebody say the decedent did not have a pulse so they initiated CPR.

Pham said he did not hear the decedent say anything when he was on scene. He said the decedent was
on his back with handcuffs on when he arrived. He said he did observe any injuries on the decedent
because there were too many people attending to him. Pham said the decedent was placed on a monitor,
provided CPR, ventilation, and cardiac medications (epinephrine).

Pham said the decedent was loaded up on to an ambulance and he was left at the scene to attend to the
injured Officer. Pham said he went back to the injured Officer who was now seated in the front
passenger seat of a patrol vehicle. He said both he and a Firefighter Paramedic attended to the Officer.
Pham said the injured Officer did not elaborate more on the altercation.

Pham said he could not recall any other pertinent details.

End of statement.

After speaking with Pham, I then spoke with Central County Fire Department Battalion Chief Jeffrey

Baker. He informed me he was one of the Battalion Chief's at the scene. He then provided me with the
following statement in summary.

The following statement of Baker, summarized and audio recorded:

Baker told me he has a phone that monitors all six of the fire stations assigned to the Central County Fire
Department. He said he has the ability to hear all of the dispatched calls from this mobile device. He

said he was at the Engine #37 station on Magnolia Avenue when he saw 5 or 6 patrol vehicles leave the
next door with their emergency lights and sirens activated. He said he then overheard the Police request
medical assistance near the area of El Camino Real.

Baker said when he heard Captain Donnelly and the rest of his crew members arrive on scene, he heard
the request for an additional fire engine and a Battalion Chief. He said due to the relative close
proximity, he assumed he was the Battalion Chief that needed to respond; however, San Bruno Fire
Department's Battalion Chief responded as well.

Baker said he left regardless and went to the scene. Baker said Captain Donnelly approached him and
asked him if he would assume "IC," which stood for Incident Command. Baker said he instructed
Donnelly to assume command of the scene where CPR was being administered to the decedent. He said
he would handle the rest of the scene for him.

Baker said all of the necessary medical personnel were already on the scene when he arrived. He said
his attention was directed to where there were two injured Officers, one of which appeared to have
watering eyes from "OC Spray." He said he asked the injured Officer that was exposed to the "OC
Spray" if he was alright, and he said he responded with, "He was fine."

Baker said the Officer pointed him to another injured Officer, Deputy Wang, who had blood on his face.
Baker said he did not question Deputy Wang as to what had happened because he was more concerned
about how he was doing. He said once he noticed he was talking and seemed relatively "ok," he went
back to the Incident Command Post and continued with the scene management.

Baker said he made the proper notifications through his chain of command per his protocol. Baker said
he never physically touched any of the patients (the decedent or the injured deputy). He said he did see
CPR being performed on the decedent and the medical personnel rolling the decedent on to his side to
remove the handcuffs. He said lastly, his last observations were of the decedent being loaded up on to
the ambulance for transportation to the hospital.

 

Baker said he never saw any injuries on the decedent because he was never closer than 20 feet to him.

Baker said he did observe the injured Officer when he was seated within one of the Sheriff's Office
yehicles. He said it was difficult to see the extent of the injuries due to the amount of dried blood on the
injured Officer's left cheek. Baker said he estimated the injury to be an approximately 1-2 inch
laceration on the Officer's left temple area. He said the Officer also told him his right wrist was injured
and Baker said he noticed redness and visible trauma to that area.

 

End of statement.

After speaking with Baker, I was informed I had spoken with all of the medical personnel with Central
San Mateo County Fire Department Engine #37. I then responded to San Bruno Fire Department Engine
#51 which was located at 555 El Camino Real, in San Bruno. While there, I met with Detective
Scholes, who assisted me with interviewing the involved medical personnel there.

I first met with Paramedic Intern Gabriel Richardson who informed me he was interning with Engine #
51 on "C-Shift." He said his normally assigned as a firefighter on Engine #51's "A-Shift." He then
provided me with the following statement in summary.

The following statement of Richardson, summarized and audio recorded:

Richardson said he knew Engine #51 was going to be called out to a scene because he saw multiple
patrol vehicles drive by with their lights and sirens activated. He said their initial dispatched call was to
support Engine #37 and afterwards they never received an update because the scene was only two
minutes down the road.

Richardson said when he got there they were instructed to help the decedent whom he said was already
on the ground. The medical personnel there informed him the decedent was in full cardiac arrest. He
also said due to him being a Paramedic Intern, it was his scene to control in order to improve his training
and experience. Richardson stated that due to the hectic nature of the call, he did not have to do much
because all of the personnel there were proficient and already knew what to do.

Richardson said he immediately started assigning other medical personnel to various tasks and
afterwards he decided they needed to transport the decedent right away. Richardson said they
established an airway, provided CPR, and "emergency drugs" (epinephrine) to the decedent. He said
they provided "four rounds" of epinephrine to the decedent. He said two of the rounds were
administered at the scene and the other two were administered in the back of the ambulance on the way
to the hospital.

Richardson said he did not notice any obvious visible injuries on the decedent's person. He said the
decedent was unresponsive the entire time he was attending to him. He said he did not hear anything
about the incident from anyone else nearby because he was too busy attending to the decedent.

End of statement.

After speaking with Richardson, I met with Firefighter Paramedic Michael Paulin, who informed me he
was with Engine #51. He then provided me with the following statement in summary.

The following statement of Paulin, summarized and audio recorded:

Paulin said they were initially dispatched on a medical aid where Engine #37 was requesting additional
assistance. He said they did not change radio frequencies while they were en route, which was why they
did not receive an additional update.

Paulin said when he arrived on scene they knew somebody was "down," but were unsure if it was a
civilian or law enforcement. He said his team immediately dismounted from the rig, grabbed the
supplies they felt were needed, and went to the scene. Paulin said he spoke with a medic from Central
County Fire Department and was briefed by him.

Paulin said he was asked to prep an "I.V." for the decedent. He said he went to the decedent's right leg
and established an "I.V." that was flowing properly. He said after it was established, he was tasked with
pushing resuscitative medicine through the "I.V." lines. He said he gave two doses of epinephrine to the
decedent. Paulin said he did not provide any other medications to the decedent.

Paulin said he assisted another medical professional with applying a "tube tamer" to the decedent's
mouth area. He said the "tube tamer" was a device used to hold the airway line in place when someone
is intubated. He said after he assisted with the "tube tamer," he helped lift the decedent on to the gurney
and in to the ambulance.

Paulin said after the decedent was in the ambulance, he attended to the injured Sheriff's Department
Deputy. He said he went over to a patrol vehicle with a medic from Engine #37 and they both attended
to the injured Deputy there. He said they then assisted him to an AMR ambulance, where he started
taking the Deputy's information that was going to be needed by the medical staff when he arrived at the
hospital.

Paulin said he noticed what appeared to be a laceration or an abrasion to the injured Deputy's head. He
said the Deputy was complaining of pain to his right wrist and that he also noticed several abrasions on
his wrists and hands. Paulin said he did not hear what had happened from the Deputy because they were
more concerned about him relaxing and them getting the information needed on to paper.

Paulin said he remembered the Deputy's Sergeant coming over to take his Deputy belt and he said they
discussed briefly about where he was going to go. He said after they were done talking, he jumped out
of the ambulance and the Deputy was taken to the hospital.

 

Paulin said he did not see any obvious injuries on the decedent's person because he was focused on his
leg area. He said his focal point was establishing the "I.V." and making sure the proper flow continued.
He said he did not hear the decedent talk or say anything because he was in full arrest.

End of statement.

After speaking with Paulin, I was told the two AMR personnel from unit 37 had gone off duty
immediately after the incident. | was told their names were Suzanne Holman and Forrest Uhland. |
contacted them both and asked if | could speak with them the following day. We exchanged contact
information and | told them I would be contacting them the following morning. Detective Scholes and |
then departed the scene without further incident.

On Thursday, 10/04/2018, at approximately 0940 hours, I contacted Holman and asked if she was
available to meet for a brief interview about her individual actions and observations at the scene. She
told me she was eating breakfast at Morning Wood, located at 260 El Camino Real, in San Bruno.
Holman said despite her eating breakfast, she was willing to speak with me there.

I then met with Holman at the above restaurant and she provided me with the following statement in

summary.
The following statement of Holman, summarized and audio recorded:

Holman said she was assigned as an EMT to AMR unit 37. She said she was partnered with Paramedic
Uhland and that she was the person assigned to driving the ambulance. Holman said she could not
remember the exact dispatched call, nor where the exact location where the incident occurred. She said
they were instructed to stage a few blocks away until the scene was deemed secure by the law
enforcement personnel.

Holman said as they were approaching the scene they had received an update that someone had been
tased. She said by the time they got to the scene, law enforcement personnel had cordoned off the area,
and said they were ushered in to where the decedent was located. Holman said when she exited the
ambulance she noticed the decedent was being propped up by a Deputy or Officer that was standing
directly behind him.

Holman said Uhland initially went to the injured Deputy who was bleeding from the head and face area.
Holman said a Firefighter Paramedic checked the decedent for a pulse and said he felt a "weak one." He
said the Firefighter Paramedic provided a sternum rub to the decedent and said the decedent did not
appear to respond. Holman said Uhland instructed her to get the back of the ambulance prepped for a
"trauma transport."

 

lasked Holman if she saw any visible injuries on the decedent and she said she saw a single taser probe
that was still lodged in the decedent's "right flank." Holman said when they rolled the decedent over to
remove the handcuffs, she noticed several scrapes on his hands and a few small abrasion on his back.
Holman said she was unsure if the injuries were there prior or if they were caused by the CPR
application. Holman said the decedent did not make any statements the entire time she was around him
as he was completely unresponsive.

Holman said she only saw the injured Deputy from a distance. Holman said it appeared as if the Deputy
had a laceration to the right side of his head.

Holman said her supervisor then told her to get the breathing equipment ready because the decedent had
gone in to full cardiac arrest. Holman said after she prepped the ambulance, she came back out and saw
that CPR had been initiated. She said she did not touch the decedent because her role was more
comprised of prepping all of the other areas for a hasty transport.

 

Holman said there was not a lot required of her because there was a large amount of medical personnel
already there. She said she then transported the decedent to the hospital within AMR unit 37. I asked
her if life saving measures were provided the entire way to the hospital and she replied by saying, "Yes,
they absolutely were."

I asked Holman if she was told what had transpired prior to her arrival. She said she overheard multiple
conversations and thought the decedent may have been driving erratically in the roadway. Afterwards,

he became combative and it took multiple deployments of a taser to take him in to custody.
End of statement.

After speaking with Holman, I contacted Uhland and asked if I could speak with him. He informed me
he was attending to car accident patients in San Francisco and that he would be transporting them to
Mills Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame. I asked if I could meet him there to obtain his statement and he
agreed.

I then responded to Mills Peninsula Hospital and met with Uhland. While there, he provided me with
the following statement in summary.

The following statement of Uhland, summarized and audio recorded:

Uhland informed me he was assigned as a Paramedic with AMR unit 37 and was partnered with EMT
Holman. He said they were dispatched to the above mentioned scene from Mills Peninsula Hospital. He
said the initial call was unclear. He said he was told there was a person (decedent) wandering the streets
and that the Deputies were approaching him. He said they were instructed to "stage out" and said the
staging locations kept changing for them.

Uhland told me when he arrived on scene the first thing he noticed was a Sheriff Deputy leaning up
against a vehicle with a "massive scrape on his face" that was bleeding. He said his initial thought was
to attend to the injured Deputy: however, he saw the decedent seated on the ground, slumped over, and
drooling. He said he went up to the decedent to check for a carotid pulse and he said the Firefighter
there said, "Yup, we've got a pulse."

 

Uhland said when he initially saw the decedent, he noticed he was moving. He said after a few minutes,
everyone around the decedent noticed he was no longer responding and that the change was "night and
day." He said they checked for a pulse again and did not feel one, so they laid the decedent on his back
with the handcuffs still on his wrists. He said they immediately initiated CPR. Uhland said he did not
actively render any medical aid himself because he was coordinating the whole scene.

Uhland said one firefighter was maintaining an airway on the decedent, another was applying chest
compressions, and another was establishing an "I.V." in the decedent's shin. He said the decedent
received two rounds or doses of cardiac medicine (epinephrine). He said the decedent's initial heart rate
was "flat-lined." He said the decedent never regained consciousness and his heart rhythm never changed
after the initial reading.

Uhland said due to the cardiac arrest being witnessed by them, they elected to transport the decedent
immediately. He said they loaded the decedent on to the ambulance and continued life saving measures
the entire way to the hospital. Uhland said they administered two more rounds of epinephrine to the
decedent during the transport to the hospital.

Uhland said when they got to the hospital, he provided his report to the E.R. doctor. He said the medical

personnel continued to provide the decedent CPR for approximately 20-30 minutes while he was there.
He said he then left the hospital and although he did not hear the formal pronouncement, he had later
heard the decedent was officially pronounced.

Uhland said he noticed visible scrapes on the decedent's knuckles and hands. He said he felt the scrapes
may have gotten worse due to them laying the decedent on his back with his hands still handcuffed
behind him. Uhland said he noticed drool around the decedent's mouth which he presumed to have been
from the pepper spray. Uhland described the decedent as looking "drunk out of his mind."

Uhland said he noticed a taser probe near the decedent's right chest area near his nipple. Uhland said he
did not see any probes in the decedent's back; however, he saw copper wires underneath the decedent's
body as he was laying on his back. Uhland said he did not take a lot of time to observe the injuries on
the decedent's body because he was in cardiac arrest.

Uhland said when he observed the injured Deputy from 10 feet away, he noticed dried blood on his left
cheek. He said it appeared as if someone had "just clawed" down the left side of his face. Uhland said
he remembered another Deputy having a possible injured extremity, but said he could not remember
where or what extremity it was. Uhland concluded the interview by telling me when he looked at the
injured Deputy, he thought to himself, "Man, he's been through it. They really fought."

Uhland said neither the decedent or injured Deputy told him what had happened.

End of statement.

I then departed the scene without further incident.

I later routed all of the audio recordings to the case record as evidence.

This concludes my involvement with this case.

SYNOPSIS:

Detectives responded to the area of El Camino Real and Millwood Ave in the city of Millbrae to assist
in an investigation with the San Mateo County DA Investigators Office. An Outside Assist case was
taken to document the incident.

NARRATIVE:

On 10-03-18 Myself and Detective Russell responded to the city of Millbrae to assist the San Mateo
County District Attorney's Investigators Office with a death investigation. Once on scene we met with
Lead Investigator Bill Massey. He requested that we conduct a canvas of the area.

Statements are not verbatim please see Vievu Recording for full statement

I contacted (W) Renee Lau, and she provided me with the following statement. Lau stated that she was
inside of the Kumon Math Center, located at 1400 El Camino Real, when she heard a muffled yelling
sound coming from outside. Lau said it was approximately 1300 hours Lau looked outside and she could
see some sort of commotion with a lot of Police officers as well as AMR doing chest compressions on a
medical patient. After seeing that she went back to her desk.

I contacted (W) Luis Coelhoandrada, and he stated that he did not see anything pertaining to this
incident, and the only thing he heard was the sound of police sirens, and he heard that someone had died.
Coelhoandrada said he looked outside and saw a lot of police cars and someone "big like me", and when
he looked outside he did not see anything. He was contacted at 1470 El Camino Real. Coelhoandrada
also said that there are no cameras outside of the store.

I contacted (W) Farida Khalid at the First National Bank Of Northern California. She provided me with
the following statement; Khalid said she was sitting behind her teller desk at approximately 1300 hours.
Khalid said she was facing El Camino when she started to hear a lot of sirens in the area, and that caught
her attention. Khalid said she saw police officers going northbound on El Camino Real, and she then
saw a black male, who was approximately 6 feet tall going towards the bank. Khalid said she witnessed
4 or 5 police officers following him, the officers were all males and 1 female. Khalid said she saw one
of the officers taser the male however he appeared to not comply and continued to resist. She then
witnessed him going away from the area near the bank. Khalid said the officers surrounded him by
Cappuccino Road, which is just south of the bank. Khalid said when he appeared to be surrounded, he
was near the no u-turn sign that is in the middle of El Camino Real. Khalid said she did not hear any
yelling because she was inside of the bank. Khalid stated that even when he was surrounded he was still
pushing the officers. She did not see how he was eventually taken into custody or what happened after
he was taken into custody as she had returned to work.

I contacted (W) Luzviminda Palatino at the First National Bank Of Northern California. She provided
me with the following statement; Palatino said she was sitting at her desk when she saw numerous
police cars arriving. Palatino said she was helping a customer that was in her line, and was also on the

phone with a customer service representative for the banking customer. Palatino said since she was
doing this she was too preoccupied to pay attention to what was happening outside. Palatino said after
the customer left she saw the decedent laying on the ground and the police were conducting cpr on him.
Palatino described the decedent as a bigger black male.

I contacted (W) Mayra Martinez at the First National Bank Of Northern California. She provided me
with the following statement; Martinez was siting near the drive-through portion of the bank and she
was assisting a customer. Martinez said during the incident the customer left to go see what was going
on outside, so she decided to follow as well. Martinez said she saw a lot of people on top of the
decedent, and he was sitting down, but he was not moving. Martinez said she saw the deputies turn
him over and sit him up and when he was sitting up his head was down. Martinez saw the paramedics
arrive and do CPR for approximately 15 minutes. Martinez said she did not hear any commotion in the
bank before the police started to arrive. Mayra stated that she had video footage of part of the incident
and that she would be forwarding that footage to me. I received the footage and booked it into a secure
digital media evidence folder.

I contacted (W) Maria Jose at the First National Bank of Northern California. She provided me with the
following Statement; Jose was working and she was with a customer, when she noticed a tall black male
outside. She said he was less then seven feet tall. She saw that he was walking close to the sidewalk.
After seeing him she stated that she went back to the counter to help her customer. Eventually she
looked out the window again and observed that the decedent was down on the ground and the police
appeared to be trying to revive him. After that Jose returned to work.

I contacted Gia Ferrer at Dr. Ankur Parikh DDS's Office, located at 1490 El Camino Real in San Bruno.
She provided me with the following statement; Ferrer was working at the front desk facing El Camino
Real, she noticed police lights in the bank parking lot, which is across the street from the Dentist Office.
Ferrer stated that she saw the decedent running, and she noticed that he was being chased by police
officers. Ferrer and he was described as a black male approximately 5'10-6'00 tall, and heavyset
approximately 350 lbs. He was wearing a blue shirt and dark pants, they could have been jeans and they
could have been dark colored sweats but they were dark pants. Ferrer said he was running northbound
on El Camino Real, and he appeared to be apprehended, there were 6 police officers attempting to detain
him. Ferrer said he was resisting arrest and then he began to run into traffic. Ferrer said this was
occurring in front of the atm machine on the sidewalk at the bank. Ferrer said the decedent was
walking around vehicles in the roadway and he was wandering int and out of traffic. During this time,
he was grabbed by two officers in a manner similar to a bear hug. At this time another police officer
pointed a taser, with a yellow handle at the decedent. The decedent was able to get out of the officers
grip and started to run again. While he was running he fell on his stomach just south of the intersection
at El Camino Real and St Helena. After he fell, he appeared to be having a difficult time getting back
up, and when he finally got back up the officers were closing in on him.

At this point Ferrer said that the officers taser went off. I asked her how she knew it went off and she
said that she saw it go off an she saw the wires on the decedent. After he was struck with the taser
prongs he fell to the ground, where he stayed for approximately 30 seconds. The decedent attempted to
get up again, however he was struggling to get up, and he was slowly on his knees. At this point he was

on El Camino, in the southbound number 3 lane. The decedent was still attempting to get up and he
kept saying "no, no, no" , and throughout the entire incident she said she heard "Stop" at least 12 times
coming from different officers, starting from when he was running, and then before and after the taser
was deployed. Ferrer said she heard several officers yelling stop.

Ferrer said he then ran into traffic and he was able to get onto the north-side of El Camino, during this
time cars were coming and this caused them to have to stop. The officers were holding there hands up in
an attempt to make the oncoming cars stop. Ferrer recalled the decedent being inn the number | lane
northbound, and there was a vehicle at the intersection of E] Camino Real and Cappuccino. Ferrer saw
the decedent touched the vehicle and at this point all of the vehicles were stopped in the roadway. As the
officers were surrounding him, a single officer struck the decedent around his stomach area with his
baton however it did not appear to phase the decedent. When Ferrer saw this happen she was shocked
that this did not cause him to fall down. She was surprised at how much energy that he had. The
officer went to try to "hug" him (Detain him) and when this occurred they both fell to the ground causing
one of the officers to hit his head on the pavement. At this point there are approximately a dozen
people video taping the incident down near the area of El Camino and Cappuccino. When the officer
was on the ground with the decedent, other officers started to come around and assisted in trying to
detain the decedent. Ferrer said they were still struggling and had a hard time trying to detain him.

From that point on, Ferrer said the incident became very fuzzy because there were too many officers on
him, however she could still see him on his back and on his belly bending his knees trying to get up.
There was an officer on his knees, with both of his hands on the decedents chest trying to keep him
from standing up. The decedent was still fighting and resisting and still wanting to get up She then saw
all of the officers on top of him and then it was a blur. Ferrer said approximately 5 minutes later she saw
that AMR was on scene an doing CPR. Ferrer said there was an officer that came in the store, and he
was wearing a light blue uniform asking for bottles of water. After the CPR was done for 7 minutes,
alternating compressions between officers and EMT, Ferrer stopped watching the incident and went
back to work. Approximately 3 minutes later Ferrer went to see what was going on and they were still
doing chest compressions. She then saw an officer with an IV bag, holding it up and that is all that she
recalls. Ferrer said approximately 25-30 minutes after the incident started the ambulance was gone.

While I was assisting Detective Russell as he was interviewing a witness, I was advised that there was
also a subject that had video taped the incident and possibly had video footage. We were notified by (W)
Dennis Barboza that his name was possibly "Ken" and that he lived up the street from the business that
we were currently at. Detective Russell and I responded to and
attempted to contact the resident in J. | knocked on the door and rang the doorbell multiple
times however there was no answer at the door. I located a neighbor and asked if she knew the resident
located at apartment #8 and they stated that all they knew was that his name was "Ken" however they did
not have a phone number or last name for the resident. I left a business card with my contact
information and my case number on the card for "Ken".

I contacted San Bruno Dispatch and County Communications and inquired whether or not they had
previous contact at that apartment and both dispatch centers stated that they did not.

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:

On 10-03-2018, at approximately 1430hrs, Detective Ordone and I responded to the area of El Camino
Real and Millwood Drive in Millbrae to assist San Mateo County District Attorney's Office Inspectors
following the death of a subject who was exposed to a Taser deployment. When we arrived on the scene
at approximately 1530hrs we contacted DA Senior Inspector Massey, who requested that we attempt to
contact any witnesses in the businesses along the street who may have witnessed events related to this
case.

At 1470 El Camino Real, an address within the city of San Bruno, at a businesses called "Signorama", I
contacted employee (W) Susan Chin. Chin said she had been at her desk in the business when she heard
yelling coming from the street. Chin said she looked out the front window of the business and she saw a
black man in a blue shirt running. She said the man ran to a point in front of a police car that was parked
in front of the store, and when the man arrived at that location Chin saw a bunch of motion. Chin said
she did not look out the window after that point. Chin said she was the only person in the business at
that time. Chin identified herself with her California driver's license.

At 1486 El Camino Real, in San Bruno, I talked with employee (W) Dennis Barboza. Barboza said that
at the time of the incident he was seated in his chair behind the front desk of the business. He heard a
siren outside an observed a black man out on the street corner. He heard another siren out front, so
Barboza got up and looked outside. He noticed the man was now walking southbound on the sidewalk
on the west side of El Camino Real. Barboza saw that the man was carrying two backpacks. Barboza
then saw two more sheriff's deputies approached the subject, and the deputies appeared to be
surrounding the man near the bank across the street from Barboza's business. Barboza said that around
that time the man had taken off his backpacks and raised his arms and the deputies deployed a Taser at
the man. Barboza described the man as a big guy, and Barboza recalled the man was mumbling. Barboza
further stated that before this first deployment of the Taser, the man had been walking towards two
officers who were smaller in stature. Barboza said it appeared the man was going to move the smaller
officers out of his way. The officers moved to get control of the man, and the man moved away from the
officers. At that time the first Taser deployment occurred, and the man fell forward. Barboza described
that the man was laying on the ground with his arms stretched out and he was mumbling. The officers
approached and told the man several times to get on his stomach. Barboza said the man kind of got up,
and he may have been subjected to the Taser again, but the man fell back to the ground. Barboza said the
man got up and began loping across the center median of E] Camino Real towards Barboza. Barboza
said the man looked at him, and Barboza thought that the man looked like he was high or mentally
handicapped. Barboza saw the officers begin to grapple with the man. Barboza recalled seeing an Asian
officer and the man fall to the ground. Approximately five officers were then on the suspect. Barboza
said one officer took out mace and sprayed the man, and another officer then got up from the group and
said he could not see. Barboza recalled that the Asian officer had a cut near his eye, and they were still
grappling as an officer said "give me your hands" several times. He then heard an officer say, "Give me
your handcuffs." Barboza said he then saw the man sitting upright on the curb and leaning on an officer's
leg. The man was drooling and had his head down towards his chest. Officers were asking the man for
his name, but Barboza observed no response. An ambulance arrived at the scene and an EMT
approached the man and shook his shoulder. Barboza said the man did not respond for approximately 30
seconds. Barboza said the officer, on whose leg the man had been leaning, moved away, and the man fell

backwards. About 30 seconds later the personnel on the scene began administering CPR to the man.
Barboza said there had been a man wearing a hat and recording the incident and he alerted an officer to
the man recording, but the officer said they did not want to talk to the man because he had been
antagonistic towards the officers. Detective Ordone and I attempted to contact this man at the apartment

building where Barboza said that man lived, at TT P . Barboza

identified himself by his California driver's license.

The businesses at 1500, 1502 and 1506 El Camino Real were all closed when I walked by. At 1504 El
Camio Real I talked with (W) Maria Washington using the Language Line (interpreter #338540) to
translate between English and Brazilian Portuguese. Washington said she had been inside the store and
went outside. She saw officers trying to get a guy, but he was trying to get away. She saw the officers
over the suspect in front of the bank across the street from Washington's business. Washington said it
was hard to see what was going on because so many cars were passing by. Washington saw people
crossing the street but said her view of the incident was not good. She said the fire department,
ambulances and additional officers arrived on the scene.

At the Days Inn, at 1550 El Camino Real, I talked with front desk manager (W) Kirankumar Patel. Patel
said he was the front desk manager at the hotel. He said that he was in front of the hotel when he
observed a man crossing the busy El Camino Real. An officer tried to stop the man, but the man did not
stop. The man was carrying something that was black and wrapped. The police were trying to keep the
man from entering the roadway. Patel said one officer alone could not handle the man, so another officer
arrived, and then another. Patel said the man appeared to be in the mood to fight and was waving his

a1 hands. Patel said an officer shot something and the man went down unconscious. The man then got up
=| and was moving again. Other police officers were arriving northbound on El Camino Real, so the man
stopped but still appeared to be uncooperative. Patel said that finally officers surrounded the man. It was
1| unknown what the officers did, but then the man was unconscious again. Patel said the man was saying
Ee no" repeatedly and the officers were saying "stop" repeatedly. Patel allowed me to operate the hotel's
=

video surveillance system and I noticed the system appeared to capture the image of the man walking
from the west side of El Camino Real to the center median, in front of the hotel. A patrol car drives past,
and the man returns to the west side of the street and starts walking southbound. A patrol car traveling
southbound on El Camino Real then stopped and an officer walked or jogged southbound in the
direction the man was last seen going and then both subjects were out of the view of the camera. Patel
said he would contact the Days Inn corporation and request that the video I had seen would be sent to
me. I later received an email with a link to a Dropbox file containing the video I had viewed at the
hotel's video surveillance monitor. I saved the video the Menlo Park Police Department's digital
evidence server. Patel identified himself by his Indian passport. Patel said another employee, identified
as "Brenda", had recorded some of the incident on her cellular phone.

rw

I contacted Brenda by telephone, using the Language Line (interpreter 663022) for English to Spanish
=] translation. Brenda verbally identified herself as Brenda Landeros. She said she had been working at the
| front of the hotel when she saw a man that officers had on the ground began to kick at the officers. She
then saw the man get up and begin running towards the roadway and traffic. The police officers went
after the man and down the street from Landeros they had him on the round for a second time. Landeros
said she did not know how the man ended up on the ground and she said there were cars in the way of

her view of the incident. Landeros emailed me a copy of the video recording she had made of the
incident, and I downloaded to the video the police department's digital evidence server.

My interviews conducted during this investigation were recorded using my VieVu digital video recorder.
When I returned to the police station at the end of my shift I attempted to download the recorder but
encountered problems with the recorder's connection to my desktop computer. When I returned to work
on 10-16-2018 I again attempted to download the recorder, and only five video recordings from 10-03-
2018 were downloaded, all of which were from contacts made prior to my involvement in this
investigation. I have contacted the information technology specialists employed by the City of Menlo
Park for assistance in locating the missing videos. I will update this case with a supplemental report if or
when the videos are recovered.

Recommendation:
This supplemental report should be added to the case file. A copy of this supplemental report should be

forwarded to the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office, attention Senior Inspector Massey, in
regards to SMDAO case 18-183-02.

SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT:

As of 10-31-2018 the videos I recorded during the course of this investigation have not been recovered.
The technology department of the City of Menlo Park has attempted to locate the videos and have been
in contact with the body-camera company, Vie-Vu, as part of their efforts to see if the videos could have
been lost either on the device or during the download process. Vie-Vu has stated that because recordings
from earlier in the day downloaded correctly, there appears not to be a problem with the camera. All
videos downloaded by all Menlo Park Vie-Vu cameras for the date of 10-03-2018 have been checked,
and none of the downloads are of my interviews in this case.

Recommendation:

This supplemental report should be added to the case file. A copy of this supplemental report should be
forwarded to the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office, attention Senior Inspector Massey.

CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION REPORT
OVERVIEW

On October 3, 2018, at approximately 1348 hours, I received a call from County Radio who informed me
that the District Attorney’s Office was requesting the forensic investigation of an in-custody death that
took place near the corner of El Camino Real and Santa Helena Avenue in Millbrae. Criminalist Cindy
Anzalone and I arrived at the location at approximately 1440 hours and met with Sergeant Trickett who
related the following information:

Deputy Wang made contact with a man who was walking in the middle of the street. The contact, which
initiated in front of the bank, escalated and turned into an altercation. A taser was deployed and used, at
least, twice. The officers and suspect made their way across the street, where the altercation ended in
Jront of 1470 El Camino Real. Cones were placed over pieces of evidence to prevent them from being
blown away.

Criminalist Cindy Anzalone and I departed the scene at approximately 2122 hours on October 3, 2018.

PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION

 

The purpose of the examination was to photograph, document, search, and collect evidence from the
scene.

EVENT DESCRIPTION

 

When we arrived at the scene on El Camino Real in Millbrae, it was sunny with a slight overcast, and a
strong breeze. Multiple large cones were located on the west side of El Camino Real, covering potential
evidence. There were also multiple taser AFID’s, pieces of a taser door, taser doors, clothing, and
sunglasses located in front of 1551 El Camino Real (on the west side of the street). Medical equipment,
along with taser wire, and a towel were located in front of 1470 El Camino Real (on the east side of the
street).

Officer Wang’s duty belt and weapon was photo documented but not collected at the scene.

It was also stated by Inspector Giguiere that Community Service Officer (CSO) J.K. Gonzales had
multiple red/brown stains located on his person from the altercation. I observed red/brown stains on CSO

EVIDENCE EXAMINATION REPORT

EVIDENCE
The following item was received from Property Officer Ashley Perez on October 25, 2018:

Tracking Number 189262: One tape-sealed evidence envelope labeled "Four swabs from Items 1891620 and

1891621" containing the following:

A) One tape-sealed coin envelope labeled "Two swabs from the entire surfaces
of the pistol with flashlight attachment and three magazines after processing
was completed (Item 1891620)" containing one swab wrapper containing two
swabs with heavy black staining

B) One tape-sealed coin envelope labeled "Two swabs from the entire surfaces
of the duty belt with pouches, holders, and key; flashlight strap; and radio
after processing was completed (Item 1891621)" containing one swab
wrapper containing two swabs with heavy black staining

PURPOSE OF EXAMINATION
The purpose of this examination is was to perform PCR DNA typing on the swabs of contact DNA.

CONCLUSION

PCR DNA typing using the GlobalFiler kit (Applied Biosystems) determined that low level partial mixtures of
DNA from at least two contributors were developed from the swab of the entire surfaces of the pistol with the
flashlight attachment and three magazines (189262A) and the swab of the entire surfaces of the duty belt with
pouches, holders, and key; flashlight strap; and radio (189262B). Due to the low-level nature of these mixtures
and the possibility of dropout, no conclusions can be drawn and these profiles will be deemed inconclusive for
comparison purposes. These DNA mixtures are not suitable for entry into the Combined DNA Index System
(CODIS).

Helena Avenue in Millbrae. Multiple deputies responded to the location and attempted to make verbal
contact with Chinedu Okobi and to physically stop him. After he was non-compliant with their
commands, a deputy deployed a conducted-energy device upon Chinedu Okobi. Despite multiple
deployments of the device, Chinedu Okobi continued to be non-compliant and combative. He also
attempted to flee. Chinedu Okobi was then restrained and placed in a prone position on the ground by
multiple deputies. Oleoresin capsicum spray was deployed and Chinedu Okobi was handcuffed.
Chinedu Okobi was moved to a seated position and assessed by deputies. Upon the arrival of fire
paramedics, Chinedu Okobi was assessed and found to be unresponsive. Paramedics initiated
aggressive cardiopulmonary resuscitation and Chinedu Okobi was emergently transported to the
Emergency Department at Mills-Peninsula Hospital. Paramedics continued resuscitative efforts while
en route to the hospital. Resuscitative efforts were also continued in the Emergency Department to no
avail. Death was pronounced at 1417 hours.

The cause of death was determined to be “Cardiac arrest following physical exertion, physical
restraint, and recent electro-muscular disruption” with other significant conditions listed as “
Cardiomyopathy”.

The toxicology test results indicated no common acidic, neutral or basic drugs, or ethyl alcohol were
present in the hospital blood sample tested.

As the death was the result of multiple measures to subdue Chinedu Okobi by law enforcement, and
based on the information contained in the Coroner's Investigation Report, Autopsy Report, Toxicology
Report, medical records, and multiple videos, | have determined the manner of death to be homicide.
