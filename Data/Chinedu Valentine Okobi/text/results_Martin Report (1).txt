Chinedu Okobi Arrest-Related Death Analysis

Report of Jeffrey A. Martin, J.D.
Provided upon request of the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office

IDENTIFICATION AND QUALIFICATIONS

My full name is Jeffrey Alan Martin. I am a retired police sergeant from the San Jose,
California Police Department. I currently divide my time between providing consulting and
expert witness services and teaching. I am a former labor relations attorney, having represented
public safety personnel in administrative matters. I also worked as an author of “Daily Training
Bulletins” for Lexipol, LLC, regarding various practices including the use of force.

During my tenure at the San Jose Police Department, I was promoted to sergeant in 1995
and worked in the Patrol Division, Airport Division, the Administrative Unit of the Bureau of
Field Operations as the Training Coordinator, and as a supervisor in the Training Division. As a
patrol supervisor, I investigated and documented several uses of force by officers.

Prior to that I was a police officer and my assignments included Patrol, the Parks
Enforcement Unit, Field Training Officer Program, and as an investigator in the
Narcotics/Covert Investigations (NCI) Unit. I served in the NCI Unit from 1989 to 1992 where I
investigated drug and narcotic-related investigations, processed asset forfeitures, and
investigated stolen property cases.

Prior to being hired at the San Jose Police Department, I was an officer with the San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District Police Department from October 1981
through December 1984. While there, I worked in both uniformed and plainclothes patrol
assignments and developed and delivered the training on the side-handle baton.

My training and experience in regard to the proper reporting, response, investigation and
documentation of police force responses includes the following:

» lam currently an instructor in the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and
Training (POST) Institute for Criminal Investigations (ICI) course on Officer-involved
Shooting Investigations;

» Ihave taught use-of-force investigation and documentation in the POST Supervisor
School for the South Bay Regional Public Safety Training Consortium and in the San
Jose Police Department Night Detective Academy; and

» [have personally responded to several force-response incidents and investigated them as
a patrol supervisor.

My training and experience in the evaluation of force responses by law enforcement

 

officers and related human factors, includes the following:

>

I have used various tools and techniques in order to control subjects in field situations.
This has included the use of batons, chemical agents (both CS and OC sprays), the
TASER, extended-range impact munitions, various weaponless measures including
takedowns and neck restraints, as well as de-escalation approaches;

For the POST ICI Officer-involved Shooting Investigations course, I was recruited to
develop and instruct a block of instruction on “Lawful Force.” During this block of
instruction, I teach the legal framework required for the use of force by police to meet
both state statutory and federal constitutional standards;

For the same course, I was recruited to develop and deliver a three-hour block of
instruction on "Human Factors." This includes how sensory and cognitive factors form
the perspective of the reasonable officer. This includes basic vision, attention,
perception, memory, reaction time, officer-subject interactions, pattern (gestalt) v.
detailed (feature-intensive) processing, time-to-stop shooting responses, human memory
compared to video cameras, fatigue, and stress reactions;

I am a POST-certified Force-options Simulator (FOS) Instructor and I served as an
instructor for the South Bay Regional Public Safety Training Consortium. The FOS
program focuses on the state and constitutional laws regarding the use of force by peace
officers, as well as the decision-making involved in using various types of force;

As a supervisor in the Training Division at the San Jose Police Department (2005-2009),
I supervised the POST FOS program, which was implemented in 1999 in order to fulfill
POST “perishable skills” requirements. In this program, my staff and I delivered this
training to the sworn members of the San Jose Police Department, as well as other peace
officers within Santa Clara County. Additionally, our facility was designated as a
“regional skills training center” and we also provided instructor training to others
throughout the State of California;

I hold instructor-level certifications in multiple defensive-tactics/arrest-and-control
programs, and I served as a defensive tactics instructor in the basic academy provided by
the South Bay Regional Public Safety Training Consortium;

While in the SJPD Training Unit, I supervised and taught classes in defensive tactics and
officer safety;

I also I served as the lead instructor and instructor-trainer for the TASER program at the
San Jose Police Department and Basic Academy;

I have previously held “Master Instructor’ certifications from TASER® International;
and

I served as a subject-matter expert in developing and appearing in a POST training video,
“Use of Force,” which was published in 2017.

My training and experience in interacting with and assisting consumers of mental health

 

services include the following:

Page 2
I served as an informal liaison between the San Jose Police Department and Sharon Roth
of the Santa Clara County Chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness;

I served on the San Jose Police Department Critical Incident Team (CIT) Implementation
Task Force;

I was a fully trained member of the CIT;

I have taught a section on Non-lethal Weapons in the San Jose Police Department CIT
Academy;

I have integrated crisis-intervention approaches into arrest-and-control training courses I
have taught;

I have presented “Dealing with the Mentally Ill,” focusing on the role of the subject-
control instructor in incorporating crisis-intervention approaches; and

I have authored an article, “Dealing with the Mentally Ill: The Importance of the Subject
Control Instructor.”

My training in the investigation and evaluation of arrest-related death incidents include

 

the following courses at the Institute for The Prevention of In-Custody Deaths (IPICD):

>

>

>

In-Custody Death Prevention Instructor;

Excited Delirium, Sudden In-Custody Deaths Forensic Analyst;

Attended the “Legal, Medical, and Scientific Constraints on Human Restraints
Symposium; and

I have designed and co-delivered a 16-hour class on “In-Custody Death Investigations,”
with one presentation to date.

My training and experience in the examination, preparation, and interpretation of video

 

evidence includes the following:

>

>

I have received personalized instruction from Mr. Michael Schott for a total of 14 hours;
I have completed a 16-hour course on “Video Evidence for Investigators,” provided by
the Law Enforcement & Emergency Services Video Association;

I have completed a 16-hour course on “Video Examinations for the Police Investigator,”
provided by Forensic Video Solutions;

I have testified as to the importance of properly analyzing video evidence in one
administrative hearing in Wisconsin and two in California; and

I have testified about demonstrative video evidence I prepared in two California Superior
Court cases.

I hold a Juris Doctor Degree from Northwestern California University and I am a member

of the State Bar of California. I also hold a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from California
State University at Hayward (now “East Bay”) and a Graduate Certificate in Human Factors
Psychology from Grand Canyon University.

My expertise and qualifications to review and analyze police-force responses flows from

Page 3
the following:

1. My education, personal experiences, and training;

2. The scope of my expertise is limited to these areas as they relate to how reasonable law
enforcement officers are trained to use force within constitutional and policy limitations;
the applicable human factors, including perceptions and memories, including basic vision
and attentional factors; and the proper examination, preparation and interpretation of
video evidence;

3. My analysis is similar to that of other experts in the field and has a factual foundation
based on widely accepted methods of analyzing the objective reasonableness of police
conduct based on peace officers’ training on the clearly established law;

My understanding of the facts of this case;

5. My recognition that there will be factors or evidence that may either support, not support,
or have a neutral effect upon my opinion; and

6. The fact I have drawn conclusions based on certain assumptions and I attempted to
designate when I relied on disputed evidence.

My curriculum vitae is attached and incorporated into the body of this report by this
reference. My professional experiences and activities are more fully set forth in my vitae, along
with my publications. It also contains a list of other cases I have reviewed for other prosecutors,
or provided testimony in trials, administrative hearings, or depositions as an expert witness.

A considerable portion of my professional life involves the study and analysis of the
conduct of peace officers and law enforcement agencies and their practices, including liability
issues and human-performance factors. I have also rendered opinions as to police practices, as is
more fully set forth in my vitae.

My agreed-to fee for performing the work and producing this report for the San Mateo
County District Attorney’s Office is $275.00 per hour with a maximum of $14,025.00, including
travel expenses and a one-time filing fee. The total amount billed will be available approximately
one week after this report is submitted.

OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT

Notice: Due to the complexity of the incident, it will be reconstructed and analyzed in the
following four stages:

Stage One: The initial attempts to detain Mr. Okobi;
Stage Two: The initial efforts to physically arrest Mr. Okobi outside the Tri Counties
Bank;
e Stage Three: The final efforts to subdue and restrain Mr. Okobi; and
Stage Four: The post-arrest medical care of Mr. Okobi.

Stage One: The initial attempts to detain Mr. Okobi

On 10/3/18 at approximately 1300 hours, Deputy Joshua Wang of the San Mateo
County Sheriff's Office (SMCSO) was on duty, wearing a full patrol uniform and driving a fully
marked patrol SUV. His radio identifier was 2B62. While driving south on El Camino Real
(ECR) in the number one southbound lane and passing Santa Helena Avenue and the Tri
Counties Bank, he noticed a man, subsequently identified as Mr. Chinedu Okobi, walking across
ECR from the north side of Millwood Ave.” Furthermore, Deputy Wang could see that the signal
for southbound ECR at Millwood Avenue was green, meaning the vehicular and pedestrian
traffic from Millwood Avenue had a red signal. Due to the observed violations, Deputy Wang
decided to stop Mr. Okobi. (Decker Report Supplement 12, p. 2; Wang MAV AFN Exhibit)

As Deputy Wang steered into the southbound number one lane of ECR at Millwood
Drive, Mr. Okobi reached the curbed median. Deputy Wang reached the curbed median of ECR
and briefly waited for the traffic signal to turn green. When the signal turned green, Deputy
Wang turned on his emergency lights and made a U-turn to northbound ECR. (Decker Report
Supplement 12, p. 2; Wang MAV, 00:54-— VLC Player). The event then evolved as follows:

e Upon completing the U-turn, Deputy Wang could see that Mr. Okobi was walking north
along the east curb of ECR, and then onto the east sidewalk, approaching San Juan
Avenue. Deputy Wang had rolled down the passenger-side window of his patrol SUV
and said to Mr. Okobi, “Hey. Hold up a minute. Hold up a minute.”? As Mr. Okobi did
not stop, Deputy Wang accelerated across San Juan Avenue, stopped along the east curb,
got out of his vehicle, and said, “Hey, stop,” to Mr. Okobi. (Wang MAV Marked AFNs,
1:06; Decker Report Supplement 12)

? This was significant as the marked and controlled crosswalk for pedestrians to cross ECR from Millwood Avenue
was on the south sidewalk of Millwood Avenue, not at the north sidewalk.

3 Mr. Okobi was wearing a small backpack on his back and carrying a duffle bag and paper bag in his right hand.
His left hand was empty.

Page 10
e Mr. Okobi changed his direction by walking behind Deputy Wang’s SUV, back across
ECR toward the west sidewalk, north in the southbound lanes of ECR, and then to the
west sidewalk, toward Capuchino Avenue. At this point, Deputy Wang radioed the
dispatcher:

County — Boy 62. Can you put me out on a ped stop at ECR and
Capuchino and can you roll me one more unit, please? (Wang MAV
Marked AFNs, 1:38; SMCSO Dispatch Audio, :24)

e Mr. Okobi moved east across ECR at Capuchino Avenue, and then started walking south
in the northbound left-turn lane of ECR. This caused Deputy Wang to have to turn from
northbound ECR to southbound, in order to safely follow Mr. Okobi. (Wang MAV
Marked AFNs, 1:52) It was during this ttme Deputy Wang broadcast:

And if you can send them code 3; he’s running on ECR into traffic.
(Wang MAV Marked AFNs, 1:52; SMCSO Dispatch Audio, :35)

e From the northbound left-turn lane, Mr. Okobi suddenly turned west, stepped into
northbound number one lane, stopped, then turned and looked back at Deputy Wang, who
was still seated behind the wheel of his fully marked patrol SUV with the emergency
lights still on (See Figure 1). (Wang MAV Marked AFNs, 1:58/AFN 3,501)

 

Figure 1: Mr. Okobi, indicated by the red arrow, suddenly stops, turns and looks at Deputy Wang.

Page 11
Deputy Wang, who was stopped in the southbound lanes of ECR, briefly opened his
door. However, Mr. Okobi started moving north and then west — back across ECR —
which caused Deputy Wang to make a 180-degree turn to his left to continue tracking Mr.
Okobi.

Upon completing the 180-degree turn, Mr. Okobi started running north in the southbound
lanes of ECR from Capuchino Avenue. This caused the traffic traveling south in the
southbound lanes of ECR to slow or stop.

Mr. Okobi continued back to the east side of ECR and started moving north, toward
Santa Helena Avenue. At this point, the radio dispatcher asked Deputy Wang if he was in
pursuit. Deputy Wang responded:

He’s on foot. I’m just paralleling him on ECR. He’s a BMA about
six feet tall about 220 pounds wearing a blue and black striped
shirt. Still walking in traffic.(Wang MAV Marked AFNs, 2:29;
SMCSO Dispatch Audio)

Mr. Okobi next changed direction, causing Deputy Wang to make another 180-degree
turn, at which time Mr. Okobi was walking north in the southbound left-turn lane of
ECR. While making the turn, Deputy Wang radioed that Mr. Okobi was “... still
northbound ECR. We’re at Santa Helena. Still running in traffic.” (Wang MAV Marked
AFNs, 2:53; SMC Dispatch Audio, 1:35)

As Deputy Wang followed Mr. Okobi, driving north and straddling the number two and
three southbound lanes, Mr. Okobi turned and started walking north again. Deputy Wang
stopped his SUV, opened the door, got out, and said to Mr. Okobi, “Let’s go over here
and talk on the sidewalk.” (Wang MAV Marked AFNs, 3:15)

However, Mr. Okobi did not comply, which caused Deputy Wang to drive north and
make a U-turn at Park Boulevard in order to reposition his vehicle to continue following
Mr. Okobi. Sergeant David Weidner, who was the on-duty patrol supervisor with the
radio identifier of 2S60, asked for an update. In response, and as Deputy Wang drove
toward Park Boulevard, he radioed:

Still walking in northbound traffic on ECR. (Wang MAV Marked
AFNs, 3:32; SMCSO Dispatch Audio, 2:15)

While waiting for traffic to clear to make the U-turn, Deputy Wang saw another marked
SMCSO patrol car, driven by Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti, driving to the area from the

Page 12
south with the lights and siren on. Deputy Wang broadcast to that unit, “To the unit
coming northbound on ECR, he’s on the median, ECR.” (Wang MAV Marked AFNs,
3:50; SMCSO Dispatch Audio, 2:33)

e After Deputy Wang made the U-turn and drove south on ECR, Deputy Lorenzatti arrived
and parked her car north along the south curb of ECR, in front of the Tri Counties Bank.
At this time, Mr. Okobi was walking toward her, south on the west sidewalk of ECR.
Deputy John DeMartini also arrived with his emergency lights on, and stopped his fully
marked patrol car facing northwest in the southbound lanes of ECR, in the driveway area
of Tri Counties Bank. (Wang MAV Marked AFNs, 4:14)

e Deputy Lorenzatti was also wearing a full SMCSO uniform and driving a fully marked
patrol sedan using the emergency lights. Deputy Lorenzatti got out of her sedan and
approached Mr. Okobi, telling him to and gesturing for Mr. Okobi to stop. At this point in
the event, Deputy Wang had spent well over three minutes trying to get Mr. Okobi to stop
and talk to him about the observed infractions.* (Wang MAV Marked AFNs, 4:16/AFN

Analysis and Conclusions for Stage 1 — Part A

California peace officers are trained that they “must know the principles of traffic
law...to carry out their responsibilities in traffic enforcement.”> They are further trained that
traffic enforcement activities results in the reduction of the numbers of collisions, which saves
lives.”6

One of the violations officers are trained to recognize is Vehicle Code section 21453(d),
which provides that:

Pedestrians facing a steady circular red signal or red arrow are not
permitted to enter the roadway unless otherwise directed by a
pedestrian control signal.’

A trained and reasonable peace officer, while approaching the green signal light on
southbound ECR at Millwood Drive, and who saw Mr. Okobi crossing ECR, apparently against
the red signal for eastbound Millwood Drive, would have believed he possessed sufficient

4 Deputy Wang had been trying to get Mr. Okobi to comply for about 3 minutes and 20 seconds, according to the
duration provided by the “Wang MAV Marked AFNs” exhibit.

probable cause to believe that Mr. Okobi had violated section 21453(d).8

Conclusion A: Deputy Wang’s decision to attempt to detain Mr. Okobi based on the observed
violation(s) of crossing ECR at Millwood Drive and against the traffic signal was consistent with
that of a trained and reasonable officer facing similar circumstances.”

Analysis and Conclusions for Stage 1 — Part B

California peace officers are trained that “probable cause is required before an arrest is
made and is based upon the totality of the circumstances.”!° In order to make an arrest, they
must possess sufficient “probable cause” which is defined as:

...a set of facts that would cause a person of ordinary care and
prudence to entertain an honest and strong belief that the person to
be arrested is guilty of a crime.!!

California peace officers are also trained that they may make an arrest without a warrant
“whenever they have probable cause to believe the person to be arrested has committed a public
offense (felony or misdemeanor) in their presence.”!” And while California peace officers are
also trained that California Penal Code section 841 requires them to inform someone they are
arresting of the “intent,

99 66

cause,” and “authority” for making the arrest, the exceptions to this are

when the person to be arrested is “actually committing the offense,” or “attempting to escape.”

California peace officers are also trained that, in addition to their training and experience,
they may rely on information from other officers, as they are deemed to be reliable sources of
information.'+!> And finally, California peace officers are trained that a violation of Penal Code
section 148(a)(1) occurs when any person:

8 A trained and reasonable officer could also reasonably conclude that Mr. Okobi had crossed against the pedestrian
signal at the east end of the south crosswalk of Millwood Drive, in violation of Vehicle Code section 21456(b),
“Pedestrians shall not start to cross the roadway if a pedestrian signal light indicates ‘Don’t Walk,’ ‘Wait,’ or shows
an upraised hand” (See Learning Domain 28, p. 3-7).

° The additional traffic-related violations committed by Mr. Okobi while he was evading Deputy Wang for the first
three minutes would obviously provide additional probable cause to believe Mr. Okobi had violated the related laws.
However, listing them here would be cumulative.

When Mr. Okobi repeatedly refused to stop for Deputy Wang, who was in full uniform
and driving a fully marked patrol vehicle with its emergency lights flashing, a reasonable officer
facing those circumstances would believe that he had sufficient probable cause to arrest Mr.
Okobi for violating California Penal Code section 148(a)(1).

When Deputies Alyssa Lorenzatti, John DeMartini, Bryan Watt, and Sgt. David Weidner
responded to the area to assist Deputy Wang, they were entitled to rely upon the information
provided by Deputy Wang in determining that they possessed sufficient probable cause to arrest
Mr. Okobi for willfully resisting, obstructing, and delaying their efforts. They were all also in
full SMCSO uniforms and driving fully marked patrol vehicles with the emergency lights
flashing. This would also cause a trained and reasonable officer to reasonably believe that Mr.
Okobi knew, or should have known, that they were peace officers attempting to perform their
duties.

It should also be noted that Mr. Okobi’s actions of repeatedly failing to stop for Deputy
Wang and the other deputies was an in-progress crime — during which Mr. Okobi was trying to
escape — which exempted them from having to fully explain their intent, cause, and authority to
arrest him, pursuant to Penal Code section 841.

And finally, there was nothing about Mr. Okobi’s demeanor or affect that would have
clearly indicated to a trained and reasonable officer why Mr. Okobi was failing to cooperate and
actively evading them. Peace officers are not required to speculate as to why someone is
violating the law and a trained and reasonable officer could have suspected that Mr. Okobi was
actively evading the deputies because he had outstanding arrest warrants, was in possession of
contraband, because he was under the influence of controlled substances, or because he was
suffering from mental illness. It is important to also remember that even trained Crisis
Intervention Team (CIT) members are not trained or expected to make field diagnoses, especially
when a subject is evading the officers and preventing them from simply talking to subjects.

Conclusion B: All of the deputies’ and Sgt. Weidner’s actions in attempting to place Mr. Okobi
under physical arrest were consistent with those of trained and reasonable officers who believed
they possessed sufficient probable cause to arrest Mr. Okobi for resisting, obstructing, and
delaying them in the performance of their duties, a violation of California Penal Code section

Stage Two: The initial efforts to physically arrest Mr. Okobi outside the Tri Counties Bank

Deputy Lorenzatti had heard Deputy Wang’s previous radio traffic and was the first
deputy to answer his call for help. As she parked her patrol car facing north in the southbound
lanes of the bank, she could see Deputy Wang’s car to the north. She saw Mr. Okobi, who she
initially estimated to be over six-feet tall and weighing 300 pounds, approaching her from the
north as she approached him from the south on the west sidewalk of ECR. She recalled that he
was carrying two large black bags and that she told him to stop and put the bags down. Mr.
Okobi replied with something to the effect of, “I didn’t do nothing,” or, “I didn’t do anything.”
(Suzuki Report Supplement 7, pp. 1-3; Lorenzatti MAV)

Deputy Lorenzatti again told Mr. Okobi to stop, but Mr. Okobi stared at her and
continued walking straight towards her. This caused Deputy Lorenzatti to fear that Mr. Okobi
“’,.Was just going to run [her] over if [she] didn’t get out of his way; he was going to walk right
through [her] and barrel [her] over.” (Suzuki Report Supplement 7, p. 2) Deputy Lorenzatti also
recalled:

He had this look in his eyes, that he wasn’t quite all there. He
seemed like he might have been under the influence of something.
I wasn’t sure. (Suzuki Report Supplement 7, p. 2)

In response to Mr. Okobi’s continuing failure to comply with her orders to stop, Deputy
Lorenzatti stepped to Mr. Okobi’s left side and attempted to apply a control hold to Mr. Okobi’s
left arm with her left hand. (Wang MAV Cropped, RFN 161; Suzuki Report Supplement 7, p. 2)
However, Mr. Okobi reacted by pulling his arm away from Deputy Lorenzatti as he continued
walking past her. As Mr. Okobi continued forward, he raised his left arm up and over Deputy
Lorenzatti’s head, to which Deputy Lorenzatti responded by reaching for the arm with her right
hand. (Suzuki Report Supplement 7, p. 2; Wang MAV Cropped, RFNs 154-186; Lorenzatti
MAV Cropped, RFNs 239-291; Weidner MAV Cropped at RFNs, 17-45 at Time Index
00:01.481)

As this situation evolved, Deputies DeMartini and Wang started moving toward Deputy
Lorenzatti and Mr. Okobi to assist in physically arresting him. The event next evolved as
follows:

e Deputy Lorenzatti next tried to take a hold of Mr. Okobi’s right arm from behind him; as
she did so, Deputy DeMartini approached and attempted to apply a control hold to Mr.
Okobi’s right arm. Mr. Okobi dropped the backpack, duffle, and paper bag (which he
had apparently moved to his right hand) and raised his hands and arm up into the air and

Page 16
out of the deputies’ reach. (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFN 357; Wang MAV Cropped,
RFN 261; Decker Report Supplement 12, p.3; Draper Supplement 9, p. 4)

Sergeant Weidner had arrived and parked his marked patrol SUV to the rear of and offset
to the right of Deputy Lorenzatti’s patrol sedan. He did so with the express intent of best
positioning the Mobile Audio Video (MAV) camera to record as much of the interaction
as possible. However, he did not have a clear line of sight with this initial action.
(Weidner MAV Cropped, RFN 74; Draper Supplement 9, p. 4)

Deputy DeMartini was able to reach up and over Mr. Okobi’s left upper arm and pull it
downward, which resulted in Mr. Okobi turning counter clockwise and toward Deputy
DeMartini. Mr. Okobi continued turning counter clockwise as he held his right arm up in
the air. During this time, Deputy Lorenzatti appeared to have grabbed Mr. Okobi’s left
torso at the side and pushed him backward, resulting in him colliding with the nearby
wooden traffic signpost. (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFNs 384-426)

Deputy DeMartini was able to get a hold of the lower left sleeve of the long-sleeved shirt
(or sweater) worn by Mr. Okobi and hang onto it as Mr. Okobi continued to back away
from the deputies. As he did so, he continued to hold his right arm up as Deputy
Lorenzatti maintained her position at Mr. Okobi’s left side. Perceiving that Mr. Okobi
was too big for them to take down to the ground, she used her right leg and attempted to
apply a leg-sweep to the back of Mr. Okobi’s left knee. However, this did not improve
their situation. (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFN 472-524; Suzuki Report Supplement 7,
p. 2; Draper Report Supplement 11, p. 3)

By this time, Mr. Okobi had stopped on the sidewalk and was facing the street, to where
Deputy Wang had moved. From his lower position in the gutter, Deputy Wang stepped
up onto the sidewalk, reached with his right hand and attempted to grab Mr. Okobi’s
right wrist, which Mr. Okobi was still holding up in the air. As Deputy Wang did this, he
told Mr. Okobi, “You’re going to get tased. Get on the ground, now.” (Wang MAV
Cropped, RFN 466; Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFN 553)

In response, Mr. Okobi pulled his right arm down and away from Deputy Wang and
turned clockwise, although he was impeded by Deputy DeMartini’s hold on the left
sleeve of his shirt. During this time, Deputy Lorenzatti again unsuccessfully tried to
apply a control hold to Mr. Okobi’s right arm. Deputy Wang also stepped toward Mr.
Okobi and placed his right hand or arm over Mr. Okobi’s right upper arm, which was
being pulled behind his back by Deputy DeMartini’s hold on the shirt sleeve.

Page 17
Unfortunately, Mr. Okobi suddenly rotated counterclockwise and moved from the
sidewalk onto the street.!7 (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFN 594-621)

Once Mr. Okobi stepped into the street, Deputy DeMartini maintained a hold on Mr.
Okobi’s shirt sleeve. As Mr. Okobi stepped back with his left foot, his left arm came out
of the shirt sleeve. Mr. Okobi next reached up with his left hand and pushed the shirt up
and over his head and down his right arm. As Deputy DeMartini still held onto the left
sleeve, Mr. Okobi continued to move away from Deputy DeMartini, with the right sleeve
of the shirt finally coming off of Mr. Okobi’s right arm. During this time, Deputy
Lorenzatti drew her TASER and followed Mr. Okobi. (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFNs
621-281; Wang MAV Cropped, RFNs 541-682)

Mr. Okobi then took about two strides away from the deputies, north along the west curb
of ECR. However, he turned and faced the deputies. During this time, Deputy Wang had
drawn his TASER and pursued Mr. Okobi with Deputy Lorenzatti to his left and Sgt.
Weidner approaching them from behind with his TASER drawn. (Lorenzatti MAV
Cropped, RFNs 650-708; Wang MAV Cropped, RFNs 564-605)

Although Mr. Okobi had a clear path of escape away from the deputies, he shuffle-
stepped to Deputy Wang’s right and then started running towards Deputy Wang with his
arms up. During this time, Deputy Lorenzatti was pointing her TASER at Mr. Okobi but
did not discharge it. As Mr. Okobi ran by Deputy Lorenzatti, he appeared to have used
his raised right hand to swipe downward, apparently between the front of her TASER
and himself.'* (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFNs 707-741; Weidner MAV Cropped,
RFNs 470-495; Wang MAV Cropped, RFNs 606-640)

As Mr. Okobi continued charging toward Deputy Wang’s right, Deputy Wang continued
to pivot away from him and track him with his TASER. Deputy Wang discharged his
TASER (First Cycle) as Mr. Okobi was continuing forward and raising his right arm up
to and across his chest.!? (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFN 741-746; Weidner MAV
Cropped, RFN 501-502; Wang MAV Cropped, RFN 645; TASER Data Download)

ht appears that a piece of equipment, possibly a tourniquet, was dislodged from Deputy Wang’s person and fell
onto the street (See Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFN 631).

18 Tt is not uncommon for suspects at which officers are preparing to fire, or actually fire their TASERs, to take such
countermeasures to prevent the probes from striking their bodies.

'9 Th Lorenzatti MAV Cropped RFN 746, Mr. Okobi’s posture is consistent with the TASER probe that remained in
Mr. Okobi’s right chest, with the other probe landing on the back of his right hand (as visible in Lorenzatti MAV
Cropped RFN 798 and per Deputy DeMartini — See Draper Report Supplement 11, p. 4). One of the blast doors from
the dart cartridge can also be seen passing Mr. Okobi in the next four frames. It also appears the TASER was
discharged just prior to RFN 646 in Wang MAV Cropped.

Page 18
e At this point, Mr. Okobi reacted to the TASER discharge as he brought his bent right
arm downward toward his torso, grimaced, and reached for his right pectoral area.
However, he appeared to have kept his eyes on Deputy Wang and/or Sgt. Weidner, and
then lunged toward their directions. Both Deputy Wang and Sgt. Weidner moved away
from Mr. Okobi in response (See Figure 2). (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFNs 741-771)

NAA ee

 

Figure 2. Mr. Okobi lunging toward Deputy Wang and Sgt. Weidner just after Deputy Wang discharged his TASER.

e After Mr. Okobi lunged toward Sgt. Weidner and Deputy Wang, he suddenly changed
direction and took two running strides away from the deputies and fell forward to the
pavement, catching his fall with his extended left hand and then onto his right forearm,
which was across his chest. (Lorenzatti MAV Cropped, RFNs 782-812; Weidner MAV
Cropped, RFNs 532-569; Wang MAV Cropped, RFNs 682-715)

e After being struck with the TASER probes and landing on the pavement, Mr. Okobi
immediately rolled onto his left side and into a supine position as the deputies tracked
him. (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 569-613) During this time, Deputy Wang, pursuant
to SMCSO policy, radioed, “Give me Code 33. We have a TASER deployment.” (Wang
MAV Cropped, RFN 884; SMCSO Dispatch Audio, 3:25)

e As Sgt. Weidner approached Mr. Okobi with his TASER drawn, he had already told Mr.
Okobi to “get on the ground,” and to “roll over.” As Sgt. Weidner approached, however,
and before the first five-second TASER cycle ended, Mr. Okobi extended his left leg
toward Sgt. Weidner (See Figure 3). (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFN 616-648)

00:21.582 RFN 642

 

Figure 3. Mr. Okobi extends his leg toward Sgt. Weidner while his right arm is still affected by the first TASER
cycle.

e Once the first TASER cycle ended (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFN 650) Sgt. Weidner
continued to give Mr. Okobi clear and repeated directions to roll over. As Deputy
Lorenzatti moved toward and tried to apply a control hold to Mr. Okobi’s right arm, Mr.
Okobi extended all of his limbs outward, apparently in an effort to keep the deputies
away from him. (Weidner MAV Cropped RFN 652-731; TASER Download)

e As Sgt. Weidner continued issuing directions to Mr. Okobi to “roll over,” Deputy
Lorenzatti, moved to Mr. Okobi’s left arm. Once there, she grabbed his wrist area in an
over-and-under handed two-handed hold and tried to take the arm across the front of Mr.
Okobi’s body. Deputy Lorenzatti also used her left lower leg and put it against the back
of Mr. Okobi’s left shoulder to add additional support in rolling him over into a prone
position for handcuffing. As she did so, she also gave Mr. Okobi verbal directions to roll
over (See Figure 4). (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 773-844)

e Mr. Okobi further defeated this effort, by flailing his arms and kicking at Sgt. Weidner
and Deputy DeMartini as they tried to start controlling his legs. Deputy Wang also
continued to tell Mr. Okobi to roll over onto his stomach (See Figure 5). (Weidner MAV

Page 21
e About nine seconds after the first TASER cycle ended, and in apparent response to Mr.
Okobi’s kicking at Sgt. Weidner and Deputy DeMartini, Deputy Wang activated his
TASER again (Second Cycle), delivering another five-second cycle and advising the
dispatcher that there had been a second TASER activation. (Weidner MAV Cropped
RFN 918; Wang MAV Cropped RFN 1,254; SMCSO Dispatch Audio, 3:54; TASER
Data Download) Mr. Okobi again reacted by bringing his right arm across his chest.
Despite feeling the effects of TASER and the deputies’ additional commands to roll over,
Mr. Okobi continued to kick as he held his arms folded across his chest until the cycle
ended, at which time Mr. Okobi stopped yelling and his arms moved freely. It should also
be noted that, during this second cycle, Sgt. Weidner moved toward Mr. Okobi’s legs.
However, Mr. Okobi raised his legs as if he were preparing to kick at Sgt. Weidner and
tracked Sgt. Weidner as he moved to the right. (See Figure 6). (Weidner MAV Cropped
RFN 924-1,080)

00:32.928 RFN 979

 

Figure 6. Mr. Okobi moving his legs and keeping Sgt. Weidner from approaching, even as the TASER is cycling.

e@ Once the TASER cycle ended, Mr. Okobi kept his arms extended toward the deputies and
his knees raised, and asked something to the effect of, “What I’d do?” Sergeant Weidner
interrupted Deputy Wang when Deputy Wang started to give another command and took
the opportunity to try to calmly communicate with Mr. Okobi by saying, “On your
stomach. Sir, on your stomach. On your stomach.” (Weidner MAV Cropped RFN 1207-
1270)

e About when Sgt. Weidner finished his sentence, Deputy Wang told Mr. Okobi, “I’m
going to tase you again if you don’t roll over on your stomach.” (Weidner MAV

Page 22
Cropped, RFN 1,334). Upon finishing that direction, Deputy Wang again activated the
TASER for another five-second cycle (Third Cycle). During this cycle, Mr. Okobi again
brought his arms across his chest, yelled, “Get ‘em off me,” and kicked with his legs.
During this time, Sgt. Weidner again told Mr. Okobi, “On your stomach. On your
stomach, sir.” (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFN 1,334-1,490)

Just prior to the start of the third five-second cycle, Mr. Okobi appeared to have been
starting to get back up to his feet;

When the third five-second cycle ended, Sgt. Weidner replied to Mr. Okobi’s demand to
get the probes off of him by saying, “OK. Get on your stomach.” During this time, Sgt.
Weidner bent down and tried to get control of Mr. Okobi’s left arm, while Deputy Wang
bent over and tried to use his left hand to get control of Mr. Okobi’s right arm. Deputy
DeMartini tried to control Mr. Okobi’s left leg. Deputy Watt also attempted to get a hold
of Mr. Okobi’s right hand, but he was unable to due to Mr. Okobi’s movements.

During this time, Sgt. Weidner attempted to persuade Mr. Okobi to cooperate with them
by offering to remove the TASER probes in exchange for rolling over onto his stomach
(See Figure 7). These efforts lasted for about 20 seconds with the dialogue going as
follows:

 

 

o Sgt. Weidner: Relax, relax.

o Mr. Okobi: Unintelligible.

o Sgt. Weidner: Relax.

o Mr. Okobi: Unintelligible.

o Sgt. Weidner: OK, OK, OK, alright. We’ll do that.

o Mr. Okobi: Unintelligible.

o Sgt. Weidner: We’ll do that. Roll on your stomach.

o Mr. Okobi: Unintelligible.

o Sgt. Weidner: I’ll take these out. I’ll take these out.

o Mr. Okobi: Unintelligible.

o Sgt. Weidner: OK. Alright. On your stomach.

o Mr. Okobi: Get ‘em off me.

o Sgt. Weidner: OK.

o Mr. Okobi: Get ‘em off me.

o Mr. Okobi: Get ‘em off me.

o Sgt. Weidner: OK. I’m trying to get them off you. (2,271)

o Mr. Okobi: Unintelligible. (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 1,700-
2,300)

Page 23
e It should be noted that during this time, Sgt. Weidner continued to hold onto Mr. Okobi’s
left hand, as he quietly told Deputy Lorenzatti to get her handcuffs ready. It should also
be noted that that Mr. Okobi rotated his body about 90 degrees during this time. (Weidner

01:04.879 RFN 1,928

 

Figure 7. Sgt. Weidner calmly attempts to persuade Mr. Okobi to roll over in exchange for removing the
TASER probes.

e At this point, as Sgt. Weidner attempted to keep control of Mr. Okobi’s left hand, Mr.
Okobi used his right hand to push himself up and to his feet. (Weidner MAV Cropped,
REFN 2,300). Mr. Okobi then suddenly shifted his weight to his left hand and arm, then
back over to his right hand, pushing himself up off of the ground, and then to his feet. It
should be noted that just prior to this, Deputy Lorenzatti had her handcuffs ready to apply
in her left hand. It also appeared that she was looking for an opportunity to apply the
handcuffs. However, Mr. Okobi’s movements made this impossible. Deputy DeMartini
also tried to catch one of Mr. Okobi’s hands during this period (See Figure 8). (Weidner
MAV Cropped RFN 2,319-2,411)

Figure 8. Deputy Lorenzatti still holding her handcuffs as Mr. Okobi quickly works his way back to his feet.

e As Mr. Okobi was working his way from the pavement back to his feet, Deputy Wang
activated his TASER for a fourth time (Fourth Cycle) (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs
2,315; TASER Data Download). However, During the previous five-second cycle, Mr.
Okobi was kicking his legs while they were between himself and Deputy Wang. In
particular, the movements of his right leg could be seen moving the wires coming from
the TASER (See Figure 9). (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 1,509-1,564)

 

Figure 9. The TASER wires can be seen running from Deputy Wang’s TASER down toward the area of Mr. Okobi’s
right foot. (Weidner MAV Cropped, RNF 1509)

Page 25
e When Deputy Wang discharged his TASER for the fourth time (commencing at
approximately 1:17.909/RFN 2,315 of Weidner MAV Cropped; TASER Data
Download), Mr. Okobi did not appear to have been appreciably affected by the current
until approximately two to three (2.8) seconds after it started (at approximately
1:20.678/REN 2,397 of Weidner MAV Cropped). It was at this point that, as Mr. Okobi
finished standing up, he again grimaced, followed by his right arm being bent and
brought across his chest, and his right leg stiffening, resulting in his falling forward back
to the pavement. A careful examination of the Weidner MAV Cropped video shows a
TASER wire running from Mr. Okobi’s right hand, down toward his right foot. (RFN
2,434) This is significant because, if that TASER wire formed enough of a connection at
or near his right foot, the probe spread (or circuit) could have changed from his right
wrist to his right foot. It should also be noted that, as Mr. Okobi fell to the pavement, he
was able to use both of his hands to break his fall, which would not support that he was
experiencing any electrical current or muscular impairment in his arms (See Figure 10).7°
(Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 2,428-2,462)

 

Figure 10. Mr. Okobi falls during the fourth TASER cycle with his right leg stiffened. TASER wire appears to run
from the TASER down to around his right foot area, indicated by the red arrows. (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFN
2,434)

20 In Weidner MAV Cropped in RFN 2,465, the probe appears to still be lodged in Mr. Okobi’s right hand.
However, there does not appear to be any wires attached to it. The wire may have pulled out of the probe during the
last few seconds.

Page 26
After the fourth cycle ended (Weidner MAV Cropped at RFN 2,464; TASER Data
Download), Mr. Okobi fell in a face-down orientation, then again, immediately
transitioned to a supine position and then a seated position. Mr. Okobi oriented his feet
toward Deputies Watt and Lorenzatti, looked to his right, raised his right hand into the air
as he looked to his right and yelled, “Somebody help me.” (Weidner MAV Cropped,
RFNs 2,464-2,577)

Deputy Wang radioed for an emergency medical response as he applied the fourth five-
second TASER cycle. (SMCSO Dispatch Audio at 4:38; Wang MAV Cropped at RFN
3,028; Weidner MAV Cropped at RFN 2,879). However, the dispatcher had broadcast
that she was sending fire department paramedics and an ambulance about 42 seconds
earlier, just after the third five-second cycle.*! Deputy Wang did not, apparently, hear that
update.

Once Mr. Okobi was in the seated position and supporting himself with his hands,
Deputy Watt had drawn and expanded his collapsible baton and issued a command.
(Weidner MAV Cropped, RFN 2,568) As Mr. Okobi was getting up, Deputy Wang again
activated his TASER, and starting another five-second cycle. (Weidner MAV Cropped,
RFN 2,672) However, the only apparent reaction to this cycle was Mr. Okobi, looking
back toward Deputy Wang and then falling back down. He did not appear to scream and
there appeared to be no other physical reactions. In fact, he again went to a seated
position on the pavement and scooted away from Deputies Wang and DeMartini.2??

As the deputies maintained a circle around Mr. Okobi, he again backed up and yelled,
“Somebody help me.” Mr. Okobi, now facing the west curb of ECR, sat straight up,
grunted or yelled, then turned to his right, placed his hands onto the pavement and got
back to his feet. (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 2,813-2,875)

As Mr. Okobi finished standing, Sgt. Weidner motioned and told the deputies to “Back
up. Back up.” As he finished doing so, Mr. Okobi started walking toward the east side of
ECR. The group of deputies followed Mr. Okobi. (Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 2,875-
3,064)

21 In his interview, Deputy Wang indicated that it was the policy of the SMCSO to send fire and paramedics when a
TASER has been used (See Decker Report Supplement 12, page 3).

22 Tn Weidner MAV Cropped RFN 2,719, one or two TASER wires appear to be stretching from the TASER to Mr.
Okobi’s right leg.

23 Tt should be noted that Deputy Wang will activate the TASER two more times, the sixth at about 10 seconds after
the start of the fifth, and the seventh at about 11 seconds after the start of the sixth. The start of the last three TASER
activations apparently occurred in approximately 21 seconds, which suggests that Deputy Wang may have been
repeatedly trying to get the TASER to work in keeping Mr. Okobi on the pavement. However, due to the apparent
break in the connection, Mr. Okobi was not receiving any electrical current.

de-escalation/dialogue to subdue and handcuff Mr. Okobi for approximately | minute and
40 seconds.

Analysis and Conclusions for Stage 2

California peace officers are trained in the lawful use of force in their official capacities,
and that “[t]he goal for the use of force by a peace officer in any enforcement situation is to gain
control [emphasis in the original] of the situation or individual(s) encountered, when
reasonable.”*+ They are specifically trained that their statutory authorization to use force is
provided by California Penal Code section 835a, which reads:

Any peace officer who has reasonable cause to believe that the person to
be arrested has committed a public offense may use reasonable force to
effect the arrest, to prevent escape or to overcome resistance. A peace
officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist
from his efforts by reason of the resistance or threatened resistance of the
person being arrested; nor shall such officer be deemed the aggressor or
lose his right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the
arrest or to prevent escape or to overcome resistance.?°

California Peace Officers are also trained that the “objective reasonableness” of their
force responses must be “fact specific, based on the totality of the circumstances confronting the
officer[s] at the time that the force was used.” The determination of reasonableness must:

e allow for the fact that peace officers are often forced to make split-second
judgments in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving;

e be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than
with the 20/20 vision of hindsight; and

e [be] based on the facts and circumstances confronting the officer without regard
to the officer’s underlying intent or motivation.?°

California peace officers are also trained that the following major factors, as determined
by Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), will be used to determine whether an officer’s use

A “reasonable officer” standard is also taught to California peace officers. This standard

asks, “would another officer, facing the same or similar circumstances, act in the same way or

use similar judgment?”®

California peace officers are also trained that their force options fall into the following

three categories, listed in the table below, each requiring generalized circumstances of resistance

Analysis of Deputy Lorenzatti’s Force Responses During Stage 2:

she was en route, Deputy Wang broadcast a description of Mr. Okobi as a black male adult,
about six-feet tall, weighing about 220 pounds, wearing a blue and black striped shirt, and still
walking in traffic. (Suzuki Report Supplement 7, p. 1; SCMSO Dispatch Audio)

Upon approaching the area on ECR at Santa Helena, she could see Mr. Okobi who fit the
description and walking south on the west sidewalk of ECR. As she approached Mr. Okobi, she
estimated him to be over six feet tall and weigh over 300 pounds. She told him and gestured for
him to put his bags on the ground and to stop.

When Deputy Lorenzatti next tried to apply a control hold to Mr. Okobi’s left hand, she
was aware of the following additional information:

e@ Mr. Okobi was a very large individual;

e He ignored her multiple commands to stop;

e He stared at her and continued walking toward her;

e She perceived that, if she did not get out of his way, Mr. Okobi was going to
“walk right through [her] and barrel [her] over;” and

e Mr. Okobi “had this look in his eyes, that he wasn’t quite all there,” i.e., he
appeared to possibly be under the influence of “something.”

Deputy Lorenzatti reached for Mr. Okobi’s left hand. However, he pulled it away and up
over her head as she passed by him. When she turned around and tried to apply a control hold to
Mr. Okobi’s left hand or arm from behind him, he raised his arms straight up in the air. Due to
his size, raising his arms, and continuing to walk, Mr. Okobi successfully thwarted her efforts to
gain physical control of him. She again attempted to get a hold onto Mr. Okobi’s left arm from
behind him, yet was unsuccessful again due to Mr. Okobi’s size and despite the fact that Deputy
DeMartini was also trying to get control of one of Mr. Okobi’s arms.

At the time Deputy Lorenzatti attempted to perform the leg sweep on Mr. Okobi’s left
leg, Deputy DeMartini had a hold of Mr. Okobi’s left sleeve. Even though it was entirely
ineffective, she tried it, she faced the following additional circumstances:

e Mr. Okobi’s size and weight, combined with his efforts, were preventing her and
Deputy DeMartini from successfully applying the low force options that she and
Deputy DeMartini had just attempted;

e@ Mr. Okobi was of much larger and heavier than Deputy Lorenzatti, Deputy
DeMartini, or Deputy Wang; and

e There was no reason for her to believe that the continued use of low-force options
would be effective.

After Mr. Okobi pulled away from her and moved off the sidewalk into the street, she
drew her TASER and pointed it at him. However, she holstered her TASER after Deputy Wang

Page 30
had warned Mr. Okobi that he would be TASED if he did not comply. When Deputy Wang
Discharged his TASER and Mr. Okobi fell to the ground, Deputy Lorenzatti moved toward him
with the intention of handcuffing him. However, Deputy Lorenzatti made one to two attempts to
apply low-force control holds to Mr. Okobi’s hands/arms and even readied her handcuffs and
was prepared to move to apply them while Sgt. Weidner was attempting to use de-escalation
methods to persuade Mr. Okobi to comply.

Conclusion regarding Deputy Lorenzatti’s force responses during Stage 2:

 

Deputy Lorenzatti’s force responses were consistent with those of a trained and
reasonable officer facing the same set of circumstances in order to overcome Mr. Okobi’s
resistance and effect his arrest. She attempted to apply mostly low-level force options which had
a low-risk of injury to Mr. Okobi. And while the leg-sweep takedown she attempted carries with
it — in many cases — a significant risk of injury, it was reasonable to conclude, under the totality
of the circumstances, that the other low-force options would not be practical or effective,
especially given the size disparities.

Furthermore, Mr. Okobi’s resistance was active, with the danger of harm potentially
resulting in becoming injured while struggling with someone of Mr. Okobi’s size and apparent
strength.

Analysis of Deputy DeMartini’s Force Responses During Stage 2:

 

Deputy DeMartini had also heard Deputy Wang’s call for emergency assistance and the
description of the suspect as being “a black male with bag.” When he got to where Deputy
Lorenzatti was attempting to stop Mr. Okobi, he attempted to apply a control hold to Mr.
Okobi’s left arm but was only able to get a good grip on Mr. Okobi’s sleeve. He tried to hold
onto the sleeve and use it to limit Mr. Okobi’s movements, then tried moving his grip up Mr.
Okobi’s lower arm. However, Mr. Okobi violently twisted one way, then the other, breaking free
of the holds attempted by Deputies Lorenzatti and DeMartini. Mr. Okobi next pulled his sweater
off and ran north, away from the deputies.

While Deputy Wang operated the TASER and gave Mr. Okobi commands, and also
while Sgt. Weidner attempted to calmly communicate with Mr. Okobi, Deputy DeMartini tried
to grab Mr. Okobi’s right lower leg, but Mr. Okobi pulled it away.

When Mr. Okobi started getting to his feet just before the fourth TASER cycle, Deputy
DeMartini again tried to grab Mr. Okobi.

Conclusion regarding Deputy DeMartini’s force responses during Stage 2:

Deputy DeMartini’s force responses were consistent with those of a trained and
reasonable officer facing the same set of circumstances and working to effect the arrest and
overcome the resistance by Mr. Okobi. He was unable to apply low-force control holds due to

Page 31
Mr. Okobi’s continuing active resistance, and he was unable to keep Mr. Okobi from getting up
off the ground, despite the fact that Mr. Okobi had been subjected to three, five-second TASER
cycles, albeit with limited effect.

Analysis of Deputy Wang’s Force Responses During Stage 2 (Four TASER Discharges):

 

At the time Deputy Wang first discharged his TASER at Mr. Okobi, he was facing the

following circumstances:

Mr. Okobi had been evading him for the previous three minutes;

It appeared to him that during the previous three minutes, that Mr. Okobi “had no
regard for his own safety or the safety of the people that were (driving) in the
roadway;”

He witnessed Mr. Okobi pull away from Deputies Lorenzatti and DeMartini’s attempts
to stop him by applying control holds;

Deputy Wang had unsuccessfully attempted to reach up and grab Mr. Okobi’s right
forearm as Mr. Okobi held it up into the air. However, Mr. Okobi pulled his arm down
and away from Deputy Wang;

Prior to starting that attempted control hold, Deputy Wang warned Mr. Okobi, “You’re
going to get tased. Get on the ground, now,” which was roughly seven seconds before
he actually discharged the TASER.

Deputies Lorenzatti and DeMartini’s attempts to physically control Mr. Okobi, in
combination with Deputy Wang’s attempt to hold Mr. Okobi from the front, had failed;
Mr. Okobi was much larger and heavier than the deputies, and he appeared to easily
defeat their low-force responses while maintaining his ability to move, i.e., he was very
fast and agile;

Once Mr. Okobi pulled completely free of his sweater — with Deputy DeMartini
holding the other end, Mr. Okobi ran south;

Deputy Wang pursued him;

Mr. Okobi then suddenly stopped, turned, and faced Deputy Wang (and possibly the
others);

Mr. Okobi then ran north, and as he ran past Deputy Lorenzatti who had her TASER
pointed at him, he appeared to have swatted downward with his right hand as if he was
prepared to block the TASER probes if she discharged the TASER at him;

Mr. Okobi continued running north toward Deputy Wang’s “outside,” which would
have provided him an opportunity to avoid being shot with the TASER yet attack
Deputy Wang from that side or flee;

Mr. Okobi could have escaped to the north, yet he stopped and confronted the deputies;
As Mr. Okobi ran towards Deputy Wang and Sgt. Weidner, they both stepped back and

Page 32
away to avoid him; and

e Just before Deputy Wang discharged his TASER at Mr. Okobi, he yelled, “Get on the
ground.”

It should also be noted that, even though Mr. Okobi had been struck in the back of his
right wrist and in his right pectoral area by the TASER probes, he initially reacted by bringing
his arms across his chest and making another lunging step toward Deputy Wang and Sgt.
Weidner, as shown in Figure 2, above.

Conclusion Regarding Deputy Wang’s First TASER Application: Mr. Okobi’s actions of
defeating the three deputies’ initial attempts at using low-level control holds to stop and arrest
him, combined with the fact that Mr. Okobi charged in Deputy Wang’s direction, would cause a
trained and reasonable officer facing the same circumstances to believe that he needed to use the
intermediate-level force option of the TASER to defend himself, to prevent Mr. Okobi’s escape,
and to overcome his resistance.

 

At the time Deputy Wang activated his TASER the second time, which was
approximately nine seconds after the first cycle ended, he was facing the following additional

 

circumstances:

e Immediately after falling to the pavement in response to the first TASER discharge, Mr.
Okobi rolled into a supine position;

e When Deputy Wang, Deputy Lorenzatti and Sgt. Weidner reached him, he had
extended his legs and arms, keeping the deputies away from him;

e Deputy Wang had been continuously directing Mr. Okobi to roll over onto his stomach,
which, like every other request or arrest command, he ignored;

e The first five-second TASER cycle only appeared to immobilize Mr. Okobi’s arms,
which allowed for him to keep moving his legs in a manner that made it difficult for the
deputies to gain control of him;

e When Deputy Lorenzatti attempted to apply the control hold to Mr. Okobi’s left arm
and roll him over as Deputy DeMartini attempted to control Mr. Okobi’s left leg, Mr.
Okobi violently thrust-kicked his right leg at Deputy DeMartini; Mr. Okobi’s arm
movements also defeated Deputy Lorenzatti’s arm-and-shoulder control maneuver.

Conclusion Regarding Deputy Wang’s Second TASER Activation: A trained and

 

reasonable officer facing this set of circumstances would reasonably believe that the application
of the second five-second TASER cycle would be reasonable to stop Mr. Okobi from kicking at
or otherwise harming his fellow deputies, to overcome his active resistance, and to hopefully
persuade Mr. Okobi to surrender to them.

Page 33
At the time Deputy Wang discharged his TASER at Mr. Okobi the third time, he was
facing the following additional circumstances:

e@ Once the second five-second cycle ended, Deputy Wang continued to tell Mr. Okobi to
roll over onto his stomach;

e During this time, Sgt. Weidner also clearly told Mr. Okobi to roll over onto his
stomach;

e During this approximately nine-second interval, Mr. Okobi assumed a supine position,
with his feet on the pavement, knees bent, his upper back flat on the pavement, and his
hands up;

e Deputy Wang again warned Mr. Okobi, “I’m going to tase you again if you don’t roll
over on your stomach;”

e As Deputy Wang was finishing that warning, Mr. Okobi brought his hands down to his
sides, dropped his left leg, placed the backs of his upper arms down to the pavement,
and lifted his upper back off the pavement; (See Garrison IMG_3665, AFNs 648-664;
Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 1,303-1,323) and

e There did not appear any other intermediate-level force options that any of the deputies
or Sgt. Weidner were trained to or otherwise prepared to attempt.

Conclusion Regarding Deputy Wang’s Third TASER Activation: Mr. Okobi’s
movements at this time constituted a pattern of movement that a trained and reasonable officer,
facing the same set of circumstances, could reasonably perceive as being an attempt by Mr.
Okobi to again get to his feet and attempt to escape. While there was no appreciable period of
time between the end of Deputy Wang’s warning that he would be tased again if Mr. Okobi did
not roll onto his stomach, Mr. Okobi started moving as if he were starting to get up before the
warning was finished (See Figures 11, 12, 13 and 14).

 

At this point in the evolution of the incident, Mr. Okobi had clearly defeated and/or
overpowered the deputies’ collective and individual efforts to use low- and intermediate-level
force options. An officer in Deputy Wang’s position would also be reasonable in believing that
he had a legitimate law enforcement objective in not allowing Mr. Okobi to get up and resume
running in and about the traffic on ECR, a major thoroughfare.

At the time Deputy Wang discharged his TASER at Mr. Okobi the fourth time, he was
facing the following additional circumstances:

 

e The third five-second cycle had finished approximately 28 seconds earlier;

e During that 28 seconds, Sgt. Weidner attempted to engage in a meaningful dialogue with
Mr. Okobi and persuade him to roll over in exchange for removing the TASER probes;

IMG_3665 AFNs 657 and 664)

 

Figures 13 and 14. Mr. Okobi appearing to get up just before Deputy Wang’s third TASER activation.
(Weidner MAV Cropped, RFNs 1,303 and 1,323)

e Deputy DeMartini again tried to get a hold of Mr. Okobi’s left leg, but Mr. Okobi pulled
it free;
e Mr. Okobi rotated clockwise, orienting his feet toward Deputy Wang;

e Deputy Watt tried three or four times to gain control of Mr. Okobi’s right hand, but Mr.
Okobi pulled his hand away each time;

e Sgt. Weidner quietly told Deputy Lorenzatti to ready her handcuffs;

e As Deputy Lorenzatti readied her handcuffs and moved toward Mr. Okobi’s left arm as
Sgt. Weidner finished his sentence, “I’m trying to get them (TASER probes) off you,”
Mr. Okobi used his right hand to push himself up off of the pavement;

e Mr. Okobi quickly turned his torso to the left and planted his left forearm on the
pavement;

e Mr. Okobi suddenly, as he continued sitting forward, turned to his right and planted his
right hand on the pavement;

e Deputy DeMartini attempted but failed to catch Mr. Okobi’s left hand;

e Mr. Okobi continuously ignored Sgt. Weidner’s multiple commands; and

Page 35
e Mr. Okobi got to his hands and knees, and then to his feet, and started to flee.

As this was happening, Deputy Wang had just finished broadcasting that Mr. Okobi was
still resisting after a third TASER application. Deputy Wang also struggled to draw his
collapsible baton. While he did not provide another warning to Mr. Okobi that he would be
tased, the fact that he was using the radio when Mr. Okobi suddenly worked his way back to his
feet most likely made it impractical to do so due to his divided attention.

It should also be reemphasized that, it did not appear that Mr. Okobi was subjected to the
entire five-second cycle. This is due to the apparent intermittent connection with Mr. Okobi’s
foot; it only appears that his right leg was subjected to the desired neuromuscular incapacitation
(NMI) because the wire from the probe in Mr. Okobi’s right wrist became entangled with and
connected to his lower leg or foot. This would have resulted in the NMI effecting from that point
on his leg or foot, up to the probe in Mr. Okobi’s right pectoral. However, once that wire became
clear of Mr. Okobi’s leg, there would no longer be a completed circuit, and Mr. Okobi would no
longer feel any appreciable electrical sensations or loss of muscle control.

The firing data download indicates that Deputy Wang pressed the trigger the fifth, sixth,
and seventh times within about 20 seconds, which could indicate that he was either trying to get
the TASER to stop Mr. Okobi, and/or, they could have been unintentional trigger pulls. This is
because, during that period of time, he had drawn his baton, pursued Mr. Okobi on ECR, and
attempted to strike Mr. Okobi, making repeated, unintentional trigger pulls more likely.

Conclusion: Given the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that Mr. Okobi
again got to his feet, defeating all the collective efforts of all of the deputies present, a trained
and reasonable officer facing the same set of circumstances, whose attention was divided while
using the radio when Mr. Okobi suddenly got back up to his feet, would cause a trained and
reasonable officer to believe that it would be objectively reasonable to a apply a fourth TASER
activation. It should also be noted that there appeared to be nothing to indicate to any of the
deputies that Mr. Okobi was not physically able to comply with their commands, and Mr. Okobi
had plenty of time to comply with the commands, as this stage had lasted approximately |
minute and 40 seconds.

Analysis of Sergeant Weidner’s and Deputy Watt’s Force Responses During Stage 2:

 

Sgt. Weidner’s and Deputy Watt’s force responses were limited to giving verbal
directions to Mr. Okobi and attempting to apply low-level control holds, none of which were
sufficient to overcome Mr. Okobi’s resistance. Trained and reasonable officers facing the same
set of circumstances would reasonably believe that such low-level force attempts would be
objectively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.

Page 36
Stage Three: The final efforts to subdue and restrain Mr. Okobi

As Mr. Okobi moved toward the east side of ECR, he turned, faced the deputies and
backed away. As he did so, Deputy Wang yelled, “Hey. Come here.” (Wang MAV Cropped,
REFN 3,166). Once in the northbound lanes of ECR, Mr. Okobi then led the deputies south in the
northbound lanes. (Wang MAV Cropped, RFNs 3,100-3,852)

Once Mr. Okobi reached the area just to the front of and to the left of Community Service
Officer (CSO) Gonzales’ marked pickup truck, he turned and faced Deputy Wang. Deputy Wang
had drawn and extended his collapsible baton with his right hand, while he still held his TASER
in the other. (Garrison Video IMG_3666, AFN 1552) The event then appears to have evolved as
follows:

e As Mr. Okobi faced the deputies and backed away from them, Deputy Wang used his
baton and swung low, aiming for Mr. Okobi’s knees.*? (Wang Interview Transcript,
18:790-792; Garrison IMG_3666 at AFN 1664334)

e@ Mr. Okobi jumped backward while blocking the baton downward with both hands.
(Garrison IMG_3666 at AFN 1665)

e As Deputy Wang swung the baton, his upper body weight took him too far forward and
off balance. Apparently during this time, Mr. Okobi struck at Deputy Wang with his left
hand. Deputy Wang reacted by jumping upward and turning his face leftward (his
perspective).*> (Garrison IMG_3666 at AFN 1691)

e Deputy Wang then turned rightward and away from Mr. Okobi, and possibly (given the
limited depth of the video images) had his momentum going backward, making it
difficult to maneuver or apply defensive countermeasures. (Garrison IMG_3666 at AFN
1731)

32 Teaching officers to target subjects’ legs while both are facing each other is a tactic taught in older and current,
traditional training programs.

33 Absolute frame number (AFN) as read when viewing the video files in Apple QuickTime Player 7.

34 Mr. Garrison did not continuously record the incident from inside Tri Counties Bank in order to keep the file sizes
manageable (See Suzuki Report Supplement 6, pp. 2-3). The metadata, checked via MediaInfo, did not appear to
represent accurate times or intervals between the six video files. Therefore, I am unable to determine the exact
coverage-gap intervals.

2 During his interview, Deputy Wang recalled perceiving that after he swung at and missed Mr. Okobi’s knees, he
felt Mr. Okobi tackle him. He did not realize that this perception may have been generated by Deputy DeMartini’s
shoulder-check tackle into Mr. Okobi, causing Mr. Okobi to collide with Deputy Wang, occurring
contemporaneously with the punch to the right side of Deputy Wang’s face.

Page 37
e@ Next, Mr. Okobi apparently continued to aggress toward Deputy Wang as he retreated
toward the store fronts on the east side of ECR. Mr. Okobi can be seen in the video
delivering what appears to be a right overhead punch, downward to the left side of
Deputy Wang’s face. This may have been the strike that caused the laceration on the right
side of Deputy Wang’s face (See Figure 15).°° (Garrison IMG_3666 AFNs 1731-1785;
Suzuki Report Supplement 6, p. 2)

 

Figure 15. Mr. Okobi apparently aggressing and throwing the right overhead punch that struck Deputy
Wang. (IMG_3666, AFN 1758)

e Contemporaneously with Mr. Okobi punching Deputy Wang, Deputy DeMartini
performed a “shoulder-check” tackle on Mr. Okobi, causing him to fall to the ground.
Deputy DeMartini believes that the tackle might have caused Mr. Okobi to collide with
Deputy Wang, causing both Deputy Wang and Mr. Okobi to fall to the ground together.>”
(Draper Report Supplement 11, p. 4; Suzuki Report Supplement 7, p. 3; Draper Report
Supplement 9, p. 5; Garrison IMG_3668.mov at :0238)

e At this point, the group was behind CSO Gonzales’ pickup truck, where Deputy
DeMartini went to control Mr. Okobi’s legs. However, Mr. Okobi kept kicking. During

56 In his interview, Sgt. Weidner saw Deputy Wang’s TASER flying through the air while Mr. Okobi was
aggressing Deputy Wang, which caused him to draw the inference that Mr. Okobi struck Deputy Wang (Draper
Report Supplement 9, p. 5).

37 During his interview, Deputy Wang remembered that he felt Mr. Okobi tackle him, i.e., “He grabbed onto me and
pulled me to the ground...I saw something out of the corner of my eye and felt a hot stinging pain on the left side of
my face” (See Decker Report Supplement 12, p. 4). However, the video and Deputy DeMartini’s recollection
supports that Mr. Okobi struck Deputy Wang just before DeMartini performed the shoulder-check.

38 While Mr. Garrison did not record Deputy DeMartini’s tackle, Mr. Garrison stated that Mr. Okobi, “...got
tackled” in the first portion of video file IMG_3668 mov.

Page 38
this time, Mr. Okobi was also flailing his arms. Deputy Wang moved to or near Mr.
Okobi’s right upper quadrant; Deputy Lorenzatti was near Mr. Okobi’s left-rear waist
area; Deputy Watt was standing somewhat to the left of Mr. Okobi’s head; and Sgt.
Weidner had to motion for southbound traffic to back away from the scene after
requesting additional emergency assistance. Deputy Watt also closed and stowed his
collapsible baton. (Garrison IMG_3666, AFNs 1,820-2,025; Draper Report Supplement
11, p. 4; Weidner MAV — Original at 2:33)

Deputy Wang recalled that he could feel Mr. Okobi pulling on his duty belt, which made
him fear that Mr. Okobi may have been trying to obtain his handgun. (Decker Report
Supplement 12, p. 4) Sgt. Weidner specifically recalled seeing Mr. Okobi grab Deputy
Wang’s handgun, which caused him to believe that one or more of the officers might
have to shoot Mr. Okobi.** (Draper Report Supplement 9, p. 5)

Deputy Wang recalled being afraid that “he couldn’t stop [Mr. Okobi]. Therefore, Deputy
Wang stood up and used one of his fists to swing at Mr. Okobi’s head. However, he did
not feel his fist connect with anything.*? (Wang Interview Transcript, 19:807-20:816)

Deputy Wang then started pulling on Mr. Okobi’s arms in order to get his hands behind
his back. He also perceived that the other deputies were doing the same. (Wang Interview
Transcript, 19:816-819)

Fearing that Mr. Okobi might again grab onto his duty belt, Deputy Wang drew his OC
spray, saw what he thought was a clear view of Mr. Okobi’s face, and sprayed a one-
second stream. (Wang Interview Transcript, 19:824-826)

As soon as Deputy Wang sprayed the aerosol at Mr. Okobi, he immediately “heard other
deputies scream in pain,” causing him to conclude that he missed and unintentionally
sprayed his fellow deputies. At this point, Deputy Wang holstered his OC spray. Deputies
Watt, Lorenzatti, and to a lesser degree, Sgt. Weidner, were adversely affected by the OC
spray. However, Deputy Wang did not perceive any indication that the OC spray had an
appreciable effect on reducing Mr. Okobi’s resistance.*!** (Decker Report Supplement

2? Deputy Wang could not be sure if it was Mr. Okobi who was pulling on his duty belt (See Wang Interview
Transcript, 40:2146-2151).

49 Tis important to remember that Deputy Wang probably took a considerable blow to the head when Mr. Okobi
punched him.

41 At the time of his interview on 10/4/18, Deputy Wang’s memory of what occurred after he used the OC spray was
limited to looking or standing up and seeing that Mr. Okobi was in handcuffs. He also didn’t remember who
handcuffed Mr. Okobi, only that his handcuffs were not used (See Wang Interview Transcript, 19:829-830).

2 Deputy Wang also stated in his interview that, after hearing someone say, “Stay on him,” that he needed to help
keep Mr. Okobi from getting up. Therefore, he knelt and held Mr. Okobi’s left arm down (See Wang Interview

While continuing try to subdue Mr. Okobi, Deputy DeMartini was still on Mr. Okobi’s
legs and Deputy Lorenzatti was to his left, crouched over Mr. Okobi’s waist area with her
feet on the pavement, her left knee possibly on Mr. Okobi and her right leg back.
(Garrison IMG_3666, AFN 2094) Deputy Lorenzatti delivered one strike with her right
closed fist to the lower half of Mr. Okobi’s body. However, the strike had no effect on
Mr. Okobi’s resistance. During this strike, Deputy Lorenzatti’s had her right leg extended
backward for support and leverage. (Garrison IMG_3666, AFNs 2124-2141; Suzuki
Supplement 7, p. 3)

As this event evolved, CSO Gonzales assisted by applying some of his weight to the
shoulder area of Mr. Okobi. Deputy Watt was standing with both of his feet on the
ground to the left of the activity; CSO Gonzales (in the light-blue uniform shirt) joined in
to assist by applying weight to Mr. Okobi’s shoulder area; Deputy Lorenzatti was to the
left of CSO Gonzales, still applied weight to Mr. Okobi’s waist area; Deputy DeMartini
continued to lie across Mr. Okobi’s lower body and legs; Sgt. Weidner moved to the right
side of Mr. Okobi. (Garrison IMG_3667, AFN 0)

Deputy Watt bent downward and assisted by using his hands to apply downward pressure
on Mr. Okobi’s shoulders, while Mr. Okobi remained on his left side with his head up off
the ground. CSO Gonzales kept both of his feet on the pavement while applying weight
with his knees and shins. (Garrison IMG_3667, AFN 260)

As Deputy Watt remained bent over, CSO Gonzales moved into a bent-over position,
with both of his feet on the ground. Deputy Lorenzatti positioned her right leg straight
back with her right foot on the pavement and with her left knee or lower leg on or about
Mr. Okobi’s waist area. During this time, Mr. Okobi could be seen positioned wholly or
partially on his left side. Deputy DeMartini maintained his position on Mr. Okobi’s legs
(See Figure 16). (Garrison IMG_3667, AFN 361)

CSO Gonzales stepped away and to the left. Deputy Lorenzatti kept her right leg back
and apparently continued to apply forward and/or downward pressure onto Mr. Okobi’s
middle back. Deputy DeMartini, while controlling Mr. Okobi’s legs and lower body,
drew his TASER but did not discharge it. (Garrison IMG_3667, AFN 405)

In response to the being sprayed, Deputy Lorenzatti, after yelling expletives, turned her
head to the right and brought her right hand to her eyes. During this time, she kept her

Page 40
right leg back with her right foot on the pavement and apparently transferred additional
weight to her right foot. Deputy Watt briefly held his bent over position before visibly
reacting to the OC spray. Mr. Okobi’s head appeared to be up off of the pavement, and
was possibly still on his left side — yet possibly more toward a prone posture. (Garrison

e As Deputy Lorenzatti maintained her posture and Deputy Watt reacted to being sprayed
by bringing his left hand up toward his face. Deputy Wang appeared to be in front of Mr.
Okobi’s head area, as Sgt. Weidner bent down and appeared to reach down with his left
hand. (Garrison IMG_3667, AFNs 485-560)

e Deputy Watt stood up due to the effects of the OC spray, while Deputies Lorenzatti and
DeMartini maintained their positions. Sgt. Weidner, to the right of Deputy Wang (video
perspective and not visible), continued to work to get Mr. Okobi handcuffed (Garrison
IMG _3667, AFN 679)

Page 41
e Deputy Watt then moved to the back of the pickup truck as he dealt with the effects of the
pepper spray. Deputy Wang appeared to have moved to where his knees were on the
pavement, just in front of Mr. Okobi’s head, which appeared to still be off the pavement.
Deputy Wang placed his left hand on Mr. Okobi’s right shoulder and his right hand down
toward his right leg. Deputy Lorenzatti’s and Deputy DeMartini’s postures and locations
had not appreciably changed and CSO Gonzales left the activity (See Figure 17).
(Garrison IMG_3667, AFN 734)

 

Figure 17. New positions after the OC spray. Note that Mr. Okobi does not appear to be flat on the
pavement.

e As Deputy Wang repositioned himself, Mr. Okobi was still mostly on his left side with
his head up off of the pavement. Sgt. Weidner continued working to get Mr. Okobi
handcuffed from the right side of Mr. Okobi at his waist area. Deputy DeMartini
continued to control Mr. Okobi’s legs, as Deputy Lorenzatti continued to suffer the
effects of the OC spray. (Garrison IMG_3667, AFN 750)

e As Deputy Watt stayed by the white pickup truck due to being incapacitated by the OC
spray, CSO Gonzales stood nearby him. Deputy Lorenzatti continued to apply weight to
Mr. Okobi with her right leg back, and Deputy DeMartini apparently repositioned himself
so that his body is more in line with Mr. Okobi’s. A public works employee, Mr. Paul
Neily, observed from the CSO pickup truck. (Garrison Video IMG_3668, AFN 0; Suzuki
Report Supplement, p. 1)

e Deputy Wang moved from the right side to the left side of Mr. Okobi, but was still at his
head area, apparently with both of his knees and feet on the pavement. Deputy DeMartini
repositioned himself by moving onto his knees while still straddling Mr. Okobi’s legs, as

Page 42
he drew his handcuffs with his left hand. Sgt. Weidner continued working on the right
side of Mr. Okobi. (Garrison Video IMG_3668, AFN 384)

Deputy Lorenzatti drew her handcuffs from her right-rear handcuff holder. After she
paused to again bring her right arm to her eyes, CSO Gonzales moved over to Sgt.
Weidner’s right. Deputy Wang continued to work from his position. (Garrison Video
IMG_3668, AFNs 462-618)

Apparently, Sgt. Weidner held one set of handcuffs in a vertical orientation, as the
bottom cuff appears to have been on one of Mr. Okobi’s wrists. Sgt. Weidner next lifted
up one of Mr. Okobi’s hands (visible just to the right of Deputy Wang — video
perspective). Deputy Wang apparently kept his feet and knees on the pavement as he
assisted, and Deputy Lorenzatti also appeared to have her feet and knees on the
pavement. (Garrison Video IMG_3668, AFNs 647-902)

Deputy Wang continued to work from Mr. Okobi’s head and shoulder area, with his left
knee on the pavement and his right knee apparently on or against Mr. Okobi’s upper back
or shoulder. Sgt. Weidner moved toward Mr. Okobi’s head, and Deputies Lorenzatti and
DeMartini continued working from their respective positions. (Garrison Video

IMG_ 3668, AFNs 1048-1212)

Sergeant Weidner moved back toward Mr. Okobi’s feet as Deputy Wang repositioned his
right knee/lower leg to more securely hold Mr. Okobi’s upper back or shoulder area. CSO
Gonzales brought a towel to Deputy Wang for his bleeding face. Deputy Wang
apparently used his right hand to radio dispatch, to again ask for medical personnel. As
he did so, CSO Gonzales applied the towel to Deputy Wang’s face. (Garrison Video
IMG _ 3668, AFNs 1237, 1295-1372)

Once Sgt. Weidner, Deputy Wang, Deputy DeMartini, and Deputy Lorenzatti were
finally able to get Mr. Okobi handcuffed and — which required using two, interlinked sets
of handcuffs due to Mr. Okobi’s size — they had been collectively working to do so for
approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds.** (Weidner MAV — Original, 00:25-4:03)

Even after finally being handcuffed, Mr. Okobi continued to move around and exhibited
significant strength. One of the deputies checked Mr. Okobi’s carotid pulse and said,
“Yeah. He’s still breathing. He’s still fine.” (Wang Interview Transcript, 19:839-844)

43 At 3:54 in the audio from Sgt. Weidner’s MAV video, Sgt. Weidner says, “bring that arm over...” Immediately
after he finishes saying that, a sound consistent with the closing of a handcuff can be heard. Sgt. Weider next says,
“Get it,” and then, “OK” at 4:02. Sergeant Weidner’s MAV audio provided a consistent recording of most of the
deputies’ efforts to take Mr. Okobi into custody.

Analysis and Conclusions for Stage 3

Analysis of Deputy Wang’s Force Responses During Stage 3:

California peace officers are trained that the common uses of batons constitute non-
deadly, intermediate force options. They are also trained that targeting a person’s head or neck
with a baton could constitute deadly force.*+ Therefore, peace officers are trained to target other
parts of the body that might result in pain or create a significant risk of injury, such as arms or
legs.

At the time Deputy Wang swung his baton at Mr. Okobi — although it does not appear
that he actually struck him — Mr. Okobi had successfully been defeating the deputies’ various
attempts to use control holds, the TASER, and dialogue, for over 1 minute and 40 seconds. Mr.
Okobi’s resistance had also been both active and assaultive during this time. This would cause a
trained and reasonable officer facing the same and similar circumstances to believe it would be
objectively reasonable to try to strike Mr. Okobi on the legs in order to prevent his escape and
overcome his continuing resistance.*>

It was after the attempted baton strike that Mr. Okobi was able to aggress and strike
Deputy Wang on the left side of his face, causing pain and potential disorientation. Deputy Wang
perceived that Mr. Okobi had “grabbed” him and pulled [him] to the ground. (Wang Interview
Transcript, 18:793-794) However, he was unaware that Deputy DeMartini had just performed the
tackle on Mr. Okobi, which might have caused both Mr. Okobi and Deputy Wang to go to the
ground together.

Once on the ground, Deputy Wang felt someone pulling on his duty belt with enough
force to move the lower half of his body.*° This caused Deputy Wang to fear that Mr. Okobi
might be in a position to try to disarm him. Deputy Wang recalled that, in response and to
prevent this from happening, he swung at Mr. Okobi’s face and head area twice with one of his
fists, but he did not perceive that he struck Mr. Okobi, 1.e., he missed. (Wang Interview
Transcript 18798-19:815)

Deputy Wang still perceived that Mr. Okobi was actively resisting the other deputies’
attempts to handcuff him. Therefore, Deputy Wang pulled on one or more of Mr. Okobi’s arms
in order to get them behind his back. However, he was unable to do so. In response, Deputy
Wang drew his aerosol OC and, when he thought he had a clear view of Mr. Okobi’s face,
sprayed him with it.

44 California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, Basic Course Workbook Series — Learning
Domain 33: Arrest and Control, Version 4.1, p. 3-7.

45 While it is still commonly trained, batons are difficult to use well. Combined with the light weight of Deputy
Wang’s expandable baton, Deputy Wang’s size and strength, the fact that both Deputy Wang and Mr. Okobi were in
motion at the time of the attempted strike, all militate against the baton being effective. However, it is still heavily
engrained in many California peace officers to attempt to use them under such circumstances.

46 Sgt. Weidner observed Mr. Okobi’s hand on Deputy Wang’s holstered handgun (See Weidner Interview
Transcript, 13:550-552)

Page 44
The attempted use of the baton, the attempted punches, and the OC spray are also
considered to be non-deadly, intermediate-force options.

Conclusion: Given the totality of the circumstances Deputy Wang faced at the time,
including the fact that the TASER did not give the deputies a clear window of opportunity to
handcuff Mr. Okobi, and that Mr. Okobi had previously displayed assaultive resistance, a trained
and reasonable officer facing the same circumstances would reasonably believe that the
attempted use of the baton was objectively reasonable.

At the time Deputy Wang used his OC aerosol, he had been severely punched and
perceived that Mr. Okobi had pulled him to the ground. Deputy Wang next perceived that Mr.
Okobi was pulling on his duty belt and possibly attempting to remove his handgun from his
holster. These circumstances would cause a trained and reasonable officer facing the same
circumstances to believe it would be objectively reasonable to use intermediate force options of
punches and OC spray in order to prevent the escape and effect the arrest of Mr. Okobi, as well
as to defend himself.

During the rest of the incident, it appears that Deputy Wang’s other force responses were
limited to attempting to manually gain control of Mr. Okobi’s arms and get him handcuffed.

Analysis of Deputy Lorenzatti’s Force Responses During Stage 3:

 

Once Mr. Okobi was down on the pavement after Mr. Okobi and Deputy Wang had been
knocked to the ground, Deputy Lorenzatti took a position on the left side of Mr. Okobi, who, for
most of this part of the incident, appeared to be maintaining a position on his left side. While she
was attempting to keep Mr. Okobi from getting up again, she applied her body weight to the
general area of Mr. Okobi’s waist. She did so by keeping, to one degree or another, one or both
of her feet on the pavement while she applied weight with her lower leg(s) or knee(s). She also
apparently assisted in getting a hold of and controlling one or more of Mr. Okobi’s arms or hands
in order to get him handcuffed.

Deputy Lorenzatti made it clear in her interview that once they were on the ground with
Mr. Okobi, Mr. Okobi “was still kicking and fighting, and [they] didn’t have control of his
hands.” Therefore, she believed that delivering a strike (punch) to “a soft spot” might cause Mr.
Okobi “to jolt his arm out.” (26:1100-1108) After punching Mr. Okobi “somewhere on his lower
body,” Deputy Lorenzatti realized that it was a futile measure as she saw no reaction at all by
Mr. Okobi. Therefore, she did not attempt to strike him again. (Lorenzatti Interview Transcript,
47:2072-2093)

The remainder of Deputy Lorenzatti’s efforts consisted of applying body weight to Mr.
Okobi and assisting with getting him handcuffed.

California peace officers are currently trained that they may use “personal weapons,” i.e.,
punches or kicks, in order to effect the arrest, overcome resistance, prevent escape, or defend

Page 45
themselves and others. *” This also applies during ground control measures.

Conclusion: Deputy Lorenzatti’s force responses consisted of non-deadly intermediate
and low-force options. Therefore, they were consistent with the actions of a trained and
reasonable officer who was facing the same circumstances in overcoming Mr. Okobi’s resistance
and effecting his arrest. It should also be remembered that Deputy Lorenzatti fought the effects
of having been sprayed with OC by Deputy Wang and kept her position, helping to successfully
get Mr. Okobi handcuffed.

Analysis of Deputy DeMartini’s Force Responses During Stage 3:

 

Deputy DeMartini’s force responses during this stage of the incident included the
“shoulder check” tackle, which he performed contemporaneously with Mr. Okobi’s punch to
Deputy Wang. Such tackles are considered “takedowns” and are considered to be non-deadly
intermediate force options.

Deputy DeMartini did not see Mr. Okobi punch Deputy Wang, but he performed the
shoulder-check tackle because he feared that, due to “the sheer size of the guy,” Mr. Okobi
would be able to take Deputy Wang’s baton away from him. Deputy DeMartini’s only other
force responses during this stage appear to be his application of his body weight and control
measures to Mr. Okobi’s legs and/or lower body, as Mr. Okobi continued to kick his legs and
fight the deputies’ attempts to handcuff him. (DeMartini Interview Transcript, 13:556-577)

Conclusion: Deputy DeMartini’s use of the intermediate level force option of the should-
check tackle, and the use of his body weight to control Mr. Okobi’s lower body, were all
consistent with the actions of a trained and reasonable officer who was facing the same
circumstances in overcoming Mr. Okobi’s resistance and effecting his arrest.

Analysis of Sergeant Weidner’s and Deputy Watt’s Force Responses During Stage 3:

Deputy Watt’s involvement during this stage of the incident was limited to bending over
and applying weight using his hands to Mr. Okobi’s shoulder area, just prior to getting sprayed
by Deputy Wang. After that, Deputy Watt was overcome by the effects and moved away from
the activity.

Sgt. Weidner worked on the right side of Mr. Okobi, about his mid-body area. He
attempted to use low-level control holds to get Mr. Okobi handcuffed. One of the factors that
made this difficult was that Mr. Okobi had bled from the TASER probe wound to the back of his
right wrist, making the hand slippery. (Weidner Interview Transcript, 13:561-567) Sergeant
Weidner was finally able to pull one of Mr. Okobi’s arms out from underneath him and hold onto
it until a set of handcuffs was applied. After telling the others that he needed a second set of
handcuffs, one of the other deputies handed him a set. (Weidner Interview Transcript, 13:581-
14:587)

47 Ibid., p. 1-13.

Page 46
Conclusion: Deputy Watt’s and Sgt. Weidner’s uses of low-level control methods (i.e.,
hands) to get Mr. Okobi handcuffed were consistent with the actions of trained and reasonable
officers facing the same circumstances. Their actions were taken to overcome Mr. Okobi’s
resistance and to effect his arrest.

Stage Four: The post-arrest medical care of Mr. Okobi

Approximately 20 seconds after getting Mr. Okobi handcuffed, Sgt. Weidner moved to
Mr. Okobi’s upper body and instructed his deputies to “be careful,” and to “watch positional
asphyxia.’”“* Sergeant Weidner then assisted Deputies Wang and Watt in raising Mr. Okobi into a
seated position. (Garrison IMG _ 3669, AFNs 0-145; Weidner MAV audio at 4:23) Immediately
after that, Sgt. Weider radioed the dispatcher that they “need[ed] medics, Code-3” (See Figure
19). (Weidner MAV audio at 4:34; Garrison IMG_3669, AFNs 145-290)

 

Figure 18. Deputy Watt and Sgt. Weider raising Mr. Okobi into a seated recovery position.

It should be remembered that the sheriff’s radio dispatcher first indicated on the radio that
she had initiated a call for an emergency medical services (EMS) response immediately after
Deputy Wang broadcast that Mr. Okobi was still resisting and that there had been a third TASER
deployment. (SMCSO Radio Audio at 3:57) It appears that once Deputy Wang first broadcast
that the TASER had been used at 13:04:33 hours, the fire communications personnel received
the call at 13:04:50 and the American Medical Response (AMR) ambulance communications
personnel received the call at 13:04:53 hours. Therefore, the first call for an EMS response was
made approximately three minutes prior to the time the deputies finally got Mr. Okobi
handcuffed.

48 “Positional asphyxia” will be addressed later in this report.

Page 47
Furthermore, Deputy Wang radioed for an EMS response about 42 seconds after the
dispatcher had already initiated one. This was pursuant to SMCSO policy and Deputy Wang
suspected that Mr. Okobi might have been injured from the TASER discharge. (SMCSO
Dispatch Audio at 4:38; Wang MAV Cropped at RFN 3,028; Weidner MAV Cropped at RFN
2,879; Wang Interview Transcript, 18:740-741) Sgt. Weidner again requested an EMS response
after they placed Mr. Okobi into the seated position at about 2 minutes and 30 seconds after that.

The remainder of the post-arrest medical care of Mr. Okobi at the scene evolved as
follows:

e Deputies Watt and Wang kept Mr. Okobi in an upright, seated position by placing their
lower legs against his back. Deputy Watt was behind and to Mr. Okobi’s left, while
Deputy Wang was behind and to Mr. Okobi’s right. (Garrison IMG_3669, AFNs 268-
1,584);

e Sergeant Weidner checked for and found that Mr. Okobi had a pulse. He also noticed that
initially, Mr. Okobi was unresponsive but suddenly woke up and looked around.
(Weidner Interview Transcript, 14: 59-594)

e Deputy Acosta arrived, escorted Deputy Wang to the rear of the CSO truck, then took his
place along with Deputy Lorenzatti in supporting Mr. Okobi.4? (SMCSO Report
Supplement 5 by J. Acosta, pp. 1-2)

e Firefighter-Paramedic David Novelli (Engine 37) arrived, followed shortly thereafter by
Paramedic Forrest Uhland (AMR 37). They checked for a carotid pulse, and Firefighter-
Paramedic Novelli said, “Yup. We’ve got a pulse.” (DCPD McQuade Report Supplement
1, pp. 11-13, 20-21)

e Firefighter-Paramedic Novelli noticed that as he checked Mr. Okobi’s pulse, that Mr.
Okobi shook his head back and forth twice. (DCPD McQuade Report Supplement 1, p.
11)

e A short time later, the EMS personnel noticed that Mr. Okobi’s condition visibly
changed, which caused them to again check for his pulse. However, they could not find
one, and they immediately started lifesaving measures. (DCPD McQuade Report
Supplement 1, pp. 11-13, 20-21)

2 Deputy Acosta’s car partner, Deputy Miqueo, stated that due to traffic on ECR being so backed up, Deputy
Acosta got out of their car about half a block away and ran the rest of the way to the scene (See SMCSO Supplement
Tp: Ds

Page 48
e Mr. Okobi was subsequently transported to Mills Peninsula Hospital, where, despite the
lifesaving efforts by the emergency room staff, Mr. Okobi was pronounced at 1417 hours.
(SMCSO Report Supplement 5 by J. Acosta, pp. 1-2)

Analysis and Conclusions for Stage 4

Once the deputies were finally able to get Mr. Okobi handcuffed, Sgt. Weidner
immediately directed and personally assisted with getting Mr. Okobi into a seated position so
that his breathing would not be impaired. Sgt. Weidner next performed an assessment of Mr.
Okobi’s condition by checking for a pulse, finding one, and noticing that Mr. Okobi actively
looked around after briefly appearing to be unresponsive. Mr. Okobi’s condition was monitored
and he was determined to be breathing and his heart beating through the time Firefighter-
Paramedic Novelli and AMR Paramedic Forrest Uhland arrived and first assessed Mr. Okobi.
Their initial assessment was that Mr. Okobi’s heart was beating at the time. It was shortly
thereafter when they determined that Mr. Okobi’s condition had changed, requiring lifesaving
measures.

The radio dispatcher and the deputies requested EMS responses at the following times
(SMCSO Dispatch Audio using the QuickTime 7 player timer):

e The radio dispatcher took it upon herself to call for an EMS response at 3:57;

e Deputy Wang requested an EMS response while they were still trying to take Mr. Okobi
into custody in front of the Tri Counties Bank at 4:38, to which the dispatcher confirmed
that EMS personnel were in route;

e The radio dispatcher asked Deputy Wang to identify the best location for the EMS
personnel to stage. However, Deputy Wang did not respond, likely because he was
attending to the task of getting Mr. Okobi into custody;

e Sergeant Weidner requested the EMS response just after getting Mr. Okobi handcuffed at
7:10; and

e Deputy Wang, becoming “frustrated” that the EMS personnel were taking too long to get
there, requested them again at 9:00.

This supports that the dispatcher, Deputy Wang, and Sgt. Weidner all made their best
efforts to ensure that Mr. Okobi had proper medical attention well before it became apparent to
anyone that Mr. Okobi had become medically distressed. It does raise the question as to why,
after these requests, that it took so long for the EMS personnel to get to Mr. Okobi’s side.

It is common practice for law enforcement personnel to, as an anticipatory precaution,
request EMS personnel to respond, but “‘stage” at a nearby location until the law enforcement
personnel inform them that the actual scene is safe for them to enter.

Page 49
The radio traffic and the CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch) printouts for the sheriff's, fire,
and AMR personnel indicate the following:

e The sheriffs dispatcher initiated the EMS notification due to the TASER deployment at
13:04:33 hours — 3:57 in the dispatch audio;

e Due to the three CAD systems being synchronized and interlinked, fire dispatcher was
notified at 13:04:53, and the AMR dispatcher was notified at 13:04:53;

e The sheriffs dispatcher entered that the EMS personnel were to stage at ECR and Santa
Helena Avenue at 13:07:37;

e County Fire Engine 37 indicated that they were at ECR and Santa Helena at 13:08:48;

e However, County Fire Engine 37 Captain Donnelly recalled that they had difficulty in
getting to that location due to the backed-up traffic, and subsequently parked at ECR and
Millwood Drive; (DCPD McQuade Supplement 1, p. 8)

e County Fire Engine 37, if this interpretation of the Fire CAD is correct, was notified that
the scene was secure at either 13:11:18, or 13:13:19; and

e Once Captain Donnelly received the confirmation that the scene was secure, they drove
forward and parked on ECR at Capuchino Drive.

It is common practice for fire paramedics or AMR paramedics to complete “Patient Care
Reports” that document the times they were dispatched, the times they arrived, and sometimes,
the times they actually get to the patients’ sides. Those reports were not provided, however a
more detailed after-action study might be useful.*° It does not appear that the sheriff’s personnel
were to blame, given the task demands and other circumstances they were experiencing.

Conclusion: In addition to ensuring that EMS had been summoned prior to Mr. Okobi becoming
medically distressed, each of the sheriff’s personnel who assisted in getting Mr. Okobi into the
seated position and monitored his condition acted consistently with the actions of trained and
reasonable peace officers and met the standard of care.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

TASER Use and Physical Restraint by Law Enforcement

The TASER primarily works by discharging two dart-like probes into a subject and
delivering an extremely low-amperage current at a reduced voltage level via an electrical

20. Upon requesting the patient care reports, District Attorney Inspector Jamie Draper informed me that the coroner’s
office was not releasing them due to new privacy laws.

Page 50
connection between the two probes.°! This electrical flow is designed to produce what is referred
to as “neuro-muscular incapacitation” (NMI). The challenge when using TASERs in field
situations is landing the probes onto a large enough area of the body so that a sufficient amount
of musculature is affected to effectively incapacitate the subject.*? For example, if two probes are
fired into only a person’s lower leg, only that area will be subjected to the NMI effect, leaving
the subject the ability to move the rest of his body.

In this case, one probe landed in the back of Mr. Okobi’s right wrist and the other to the
lateral area of his right pectoral muscle. This is why, when Mr. Okobi was experiencing the first
three, five-second cycles, he involuntarily moved his right arm across his chest, indicating there
was an NMI effect between those two points. However, this left him with the abilities of moving
his upper torso and his lower legs, which allowed him to quickly roll into the supine position and
extend his legs. This, combined with his very large size (6 feet 2 inches and 333 pounds), made
approaching and trying to handcuff him very difficult. Additionally, as soon as the cycles ended,
Mr. Okobi fully extended his arms and would move them whenever the deputies attempted to
apply control holds.

Legally, the courts have identified the use of TASERs — using the probes — as “an
intermediate, if nonlethal, level of force,” and as “non-deadly force.’*>*4

In 2009, TASER, International issued TASER Training Bulletin 15.0 explaining why the
“preferred target zone” for TASER usage had changed. Due to medical research that suggested
there was a slight chance of inducing cardiac arrhythmias in humans if the TASER probes would
become too close (measured in millimeters) to the heart. As a precautionary result, as well as
recognizing that narrow probe spreads on the chest area tended to be less effective, TASER
recommended not intentionally targeting the chest area.*> However, this has not resulted in the
use of the TASER, even when directed at the chest, to be deemed “deadly force.” It also does not
mean that, given the totality of the dynamic circumstances under which Deputy Wang used the
TASER, he violated the training standards.

It should also be noted that, even with the medical professionals who have cited a very
few case studies where they believe TASERs induced cardiac arrhythmias and resulting in
deaths, those subjects lost consciousness at the end of the TASER cycle(s), or immediately upon
the start of the TASER cycle. In this case, Mr. Okobi did not lose consciousness for several
minutes after the fourth TASER activation, and after a few more minutes of heavy physical
exertion. Furthermore, the placement of the probe to the area lateral to Mr. Okobi’s right pectoral
muscle, likely placed it far outside of the “dart-to-heart” distance that would incur a risk of

5! While the manufacturer identifies the voltage produced by the TASER as being 50,000, this is the voltage at the
device when the current is arcing between the front contacts. Once the probes make a connection in a body, that
voltage drops to approximately 800 to 1,400.

“cardiomyopathy” as a “contributing but not related to the immediate cause of death.” This is
consistent with research that places the NMI effects under the umbrella of exertional
physiological-stress responses when compared to other non-deadly force options. One study
concluded:

In general, the stress of receiving CED discharge(s) should be considered to be of
a magnitude that is comparable to the stress of other components of subdual. All
aspects of an altercation, (including verbal altercation, physical struggle or
physical restraint) constitute stress that may heighten the risk of sudden death in
individuals who have pre-existing cardiac or other significant disease.*°

Another study concluded that the physiological stress induced by a five-second TASER
discharge was less than or equal to that of running a 20-meter sprint.>” This supports the concept
that there is little or no difference between the physiological exertional effects of the physical
exertion displayed by Mr. Okobi, the physical exertion during his resistance to being physically
restrained, and the exertion effects of the TASER.

Regarding the coroner’s observation of Mr. Okobi’s cardiomyopathy, additional context
might be helpful to the public. This is important, because 366,807 people in the United States
died from sudden cardiac arrest in 2015.°° Sudden cardiac arrest occurs in both older and
younger athletes, frequently attributed to undiagnosed heart conditions, and that “vigorous
exertion may act as a trigger of...sudden cardiac death in susceptible individuals.”*? And finally,
those with mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, tend to have significantly higher mortality

rates from cardiovascular disease due to lifestyle and other factors. *!

This information, in support of the coroner’s findings, combined with the totality of the
circumstances under which the deputies acted, indicates that there is currently no evidence to
suggest that any of the deputies, either individually or collectively, took any actions that would,
with reasonable foreseeability, cause the death of Mr. Okobi. All of their force responses
constituted non-deadly, intermediate force, or less.

Crisis Intervention Team Training (CIT) and De-escalation

The following involved personnel had attended CIT or training specific to de-escalation
strategies:
e Deputy Wang: CIT and De-escalation during his previous tenure at the San Francisco
Police Department;
Deputy Lorenzatti: CIT and Tactical Communications;
Deputy DeMartini: CIT and Tactical Communications;
Deputy Watt: Tactical Communications; and

Sergeant Weidner: CIT and Tactical Communications.

In order to successfully apply de-escalation methods, the circumstances must allow for
the following three things to occur:

(1) Establish contact, i.e., the person with which an officer is attempting to communicate
with must be able to engage in a meaningful conversation with the officer;

(2) Establish rapport; and

(3) Use persuasion to get the other party to accept that it is in his or her best interest to
cooperate with the officer.

It was very apparent that Mr. Okobi was either not willing or able to stop and listen to Deputy
Wang and have a meaningful conversation about the issue of his crossing ECR against the traffic
signals. Without meaningful communication, the other two steps, especially persuasion, are
unlikely to be completed. It should be noted that Sgt. Weidner attempted to try to persuade Mr.
Okobi to submit to being arrested, i.e., to roll over onto into a prone position in exchange for
removing the TASER probes, during the 20-second period. It is also very important to remember
that, just because an officer attempts to apply de-escalation approaches, they will not work every

Accountability Measures

In order to ensure impartiality and accountability, the San Mateo Police Chief’s and
Sheriff Association has implemented an Officer-Involved Critical Incident Protocol. Like other
county-wide protocols, it pre-determines which law enforcement agencies take the lead in
conducting such investigations, and what roles the involved agencies will play.

The San Mateo County protocol provides that the District Attorney’s Office and the
agency which has jurisdiction over the location of the incidents will have joint investigative
responsibility. However, like other county-wide-protocol investigations I have reviewed, it is
clear that the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office actually assumes the leading role and
provides the primary investigation and documentation, with the other agencies playing support
roles.

The involved SMCSO personnel all had operational mobile-audio video (MAV)
equipment in their patrol vehicles, which provided a large portion of the data used in this
analysis. Each deputy normally attaches the microphone for the MAV equipment in their vehicle
to their uniforms, which allows for fairly remote audio recording capabilities, even when away
from the immediate vicinities of their vehicles.

The only exceptions to this were that Deputy Watt’s MAV microphone was missing from
his patrol vehicle when he started his shift earlier that morning; Deputy DeMartini’s MAV
microphone was missing from the patrol vehicle he used that day, which was not his normal
vehicle. While this did not result in an appreciable loss of information about the incident, the
SMCSO should take steps to ensure such occurrences are minimized.

Organizational and System Factors

Whenever unpopular and undesirable outcomes occur, especially in law enforcement,
much of the scrutiny is focused upon the individuals.®? Therefore, it is vital that law enforcement
agencies constantly look for contemporary training methods intended to meet certain objectives.

In this case, the objective was to apprehend and restrain Mr. Okobi as soon as possible
using objectively reasonable force under the totality of the circumstances. This is because, the
longer such incidents last, the chances of serious injuries occurring — to both officers and
subjects — increase. And while Mr. Okobi’s size, strength, and agility would pose a tremendous
challenge to restrain regardless of approach, the multiple attempts at chasing Mr. Okobi’s hands
and feet were clearly ineffective. Instead, the contemporary approaches train officers to control
entire limbs or sections of bodies, using most of the officers’ bodies.

Another reason is, certain people are more likely to die from the effects of the sudden and
prolonged exertion due to their resistance. This is especially true with those who are at higher

risk of sudden cardiac death or in states of excited delirium. Therefore, the objective is to
apprehend, restrain, and turn such persons over to EMS personnel as soon as possible.

Therefore, the SMCSO might want to explore more in-depth scenario-based training with
their TASERs. Just as importantly, the SMCSO should also explore adopting multiple-officer
takedown and control methods, such as P.E.P., created by Lieutenant John Domingo of the
Huntington Beach, California Police Department.°?-

The efforts to apprehend and restrain Mr. Okobi would have presented tremendous
challenges to virtually any group of law enforcement officers. However, despite the tragic
outcome of this incident, it appears the deputies and Sgt. Weidner did the best they could with
the tools, training, and experience they possessed at the time.
