Master Summary Report

SUMMARY

On October 3, 2018 at approximately 1:00 PM, San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Joshua
Wang attempted to conduct a pedestrian stop of a subject ultimately identified as Decedent
Chinedu Okobi in the 1400 block of El Camino Real in the City of Millbrae. Deputy Wang first
observed Decedent Okobi walking eastbound across the lanes of southbound and northbound
traffic on El Camino Real in violation of California Vehicle Code section 21955. Deputy Wang
attempted to initiate contact with Decedent Okobi on the east side of El Camino Real; however,
Decedent Okobi went back westbound across traffic disregarding Deputy Wang’s verbal
commands to stop. Deputy Wang made several U-tums on El Camino Real attempting to contact
Decedent Okobi as he went back and forth across the lanes of traffic and ran north in the middle
of the roadway. Deputy Wang requested additional deputies to respond to his location to assist in
detaining Decedent Okobi.

Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti and Deputy John DeMartini arrived in the area and attempted to contact
Decedent Okobi as he was walking southbound on the sidewalk along the west side of El] Camino
Real. Deputy Lorenzatti tried to grab Decedent Okobi’s left hand; however, Decedent Okobi pulled
his hand away from Deputy Lorenzatti. Deputy DeMartini also attempted to grab Decedent
Okobi’s arm, grasping Okobi’s long sleeved shirt. Decedent Okobi pulled away from Deputy
DeMartini and was able to pull himself out of the shirt and Deputy DeMartini’s grasp. Decedent
Okobi turned to flee from the deputies, then changed his path of travel and advanced toward
Deputy Wang. Deputy Wang drew his Taser and issued a warning to Decedent Okobi to comply
or the Taser would be used. Deputy Wang activated his Taser at Decedent Okobi as Okobi

appeared to reach out in either a grabbing or swatting motion toward Deputy Wang’s Taser which
resulted in the two (2) probes of the Taser striking Decedent Okobi in the back of the right hand
or forearm and the right side of his upper torso/chest. Chinedu Okobi then fell to the ground during
the five (5) second activation period of the Taser. Deputy Bryan Watt and Sergeant David Weidner
arrived on the scene and attempted to assist Deputy Wang, Deputy Lorenzatti, and Deputy
DeMartini in attempting to get Decedent Okobi to comply with verbal commands to roll over on
his stomach so Okobi could be handcuffed. The involved deputies made several attempts to grab
Decedent Okobi’s arms and leg; however, Okobi was repeatedly able to pull away from them and
kick at the involved deputies. Deputy Wang conducted a second, five (5) second activation of his
Taser while Decedent Okobi was on the ground, actively resisting attempts by the deputies to gain
compliance.

Decedent Okobi was able to get back on his feet and push Deputy DeMartini away from him. As
Decedent Okobi attempted to walk away from the Deputies, Deputy Wang conducted a third, five
(5) second activation of his Taser, which caused Okobi to fall back to the ground. Deputy Wang
activated a fourth, ineffective attempt with his Taser as Decedent Okobi tried again to stand up.
Decedent Okobi was able to stand and began to move eastbound and then southbound on El
Camino Real in the lanes of traffic as Deputy Wang made two (2) additional, ineffective attempts
to deploy his Taser. Deputy Wang drew his ASP (collapsible baton) and tried to strike Decedent
Okobi with the ASP; however, Deputy Wang was then punched on the left side of his head at least
one (1) time by Okobi. Decedent Okobi grabbed Deputy Wang around the waist and grasped
Deputy Wang’s holstered firearm when Deputy DeMartini was able to knock Decedent Okobi to
the ground. Deputy Wang, Deputy Lorenzatti, Deputy Watt, Deputy DeMartini and Sergeant
Weidner then struggled with Decedent Okobi on the ground for several minutes while attempting
to get control of Okobi and place him in handcuffs. During the struggle on the ground, Deputy
Wang deployed his pepper spray, which inadvertently struck Deputy Watt, Deputy Lorenzatti and
Sergeant Weidner in the face and eyes.

The involved deputies were ultimately able to place two (2) sets of interlocked handcuffs on
Decedent Okobi’s wrists and get him under control. At Sergeant Weidner’s direction, the involved
deputies rolled Decedent Okobi to his side and ultimately to a seated position to avoid potential
positional asphyxia. The deputies then summoned medical attention to the scene. Several minutes
later, while being attended to by emergency medical personnel, Decedent Okobi went into cardiac
arrest. Attempts were made by emergency medical personnel to revive Decedent Okobi who was
transported Mills-Peninsula Hospital for additional medical treatment. Emergency medical staff at
Mills-Peninsula Hospital were unable to revive Decedent Okobi. Portions of the incident were
captured on Mobile Audio Video (MAV) cameras in the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office patrol
vehicles as well as via a cellular phone video recorded by Witness Robert Garrison at the scene.

The San Mateo County Officer Involved Critical Incident Protocol was enacted.

PERTINENT WITNESS STATEMENTS (Summarized herein):

Statement of Witness: Robert Garrison

Robert Garrison was interviewed at his residence on October 3, 2018 by Inspector Eric Suzuki.
Garrison stated he was inside the Tri Counties Bank located at 1551 El Camino Real, Millbrae
where he was at the teller stand. Garrison said he heard some of the bank tellers start to yell.
Garrison said he turned around and saw two (2) police vehicles arrive and saw a subject determined
to be Decedent Okobi. Garrison described Decedent Okobi as being “very large, 6 feet or taller,
heavy build, African American, weight maybe 270”. Garrison described Decedent Okobi as
looking “really crazy” and “was just going around like he was going to fight somebody”. Garrison
said it appeared to him that Decedent Okobi was running away from the officers and had removed
his sweater “like he was getting ready to fight or flee”. Garrison said he took out his cellular phone
and recorded the activity after seeing that Okobi had been “tased” by what he described as a “tall,
Asian-American officer” (Deputy Joshua Wang). Garrison recorded a total of six (6) short video
clips of the incident, which he voluntarily provided to Inspector Suzuki.

Garrison stated he saw Decedent Okobi on the ground “squirming around a little bit, still resisting
and had his hands up”. Garrison said the deputies tried to approach Decedent Okobi to “maybe
arrest him” but Okobi was moving around a lot. Garrison believed he saw Decedent Okobi rip the
Taser wires off and saw Okobi get back on his feet again before being “tased” a second time. Prior
to being “tased” the second time, Garrison said Decedent Okobi swung at one of the deputies and
knocked the deputy’s glasses off. Garrison described the deputy as “a short, Caucasian officer”
(Deputy John DeMartini). Garrison said Decedent Okobi fell to the ground after being “tased” the
second time and was behind a police vehicle, so Garrison was unable to see what was occurring.
Garrison moved to a better vantage point and was able to see Decedent Okobi get back up and said
Okobi began to run east toward the northbound lanes of El Camino Real. Garrison said there was
a portion which occurred in between his video segments in which he saw Decedent Okobi drag
Deputy Wang to the ground. Garrison described Decedent Okobi as “resisting and assaulting the
officer” and said this occurred between two (2) segments of video he recorded. Garrison said the
first segment showed Decedent Okobi punch Deputy Wang in the face. Garrison said the next
video segment then showed Decedent Okobi already being subdued on the ground. Garrison
described the struggle on the ground between the deputies and Decedent Okobi as lasting an
estimated five (5) to ten (10) minutes before Okobi was subdued and handcuffed. Garrison recalled
seeing Decedent Okobi in a seated position after being handcuffed and noted Okobi “looked like
he was conscious for sure”. Garrison said Decedent Okobi was being loaded onto a gurney when
he left the area.

Garrison did state he observed a stocky, bald Caucasian deputy (Deputy Bryan Watt) use a baton
during the incident. Garrison believed Deputy Watt struck Decedent Okobi once with the baton,
but it appeared to his as though Okobi did not feel anything.

Statement of Witness: Farida Khalid

In accordance with the Officer-Involved Critical Incident (OICI) Protocol, Detective Jeremy
Ordone of the Menlo Park Police Department responded to assist with the interviewing of
witnesses in this investigation. Detective Ordone interviewed Farida Khalid on October 3, 2018 at
the Tri Counties Bank, 1551 El Camino Real, Millbrae.

Khalid, an employee of the bank, was behind her teller desk when she observed a black male who
she estimated was approximately six (6) feet tall (Decedent Chinedu Okobi) walking toward the
bank on El Camino Real. Khalid observed four (4) or five (5) Sheriff's Deputies following
Decedent Okobi. Khalid saw one of the deputies utilize a Taser on Decedent Okobi and said Okobi
appeared to not comply and continued to resist. Khalid saw Decedent Okobi move away from the
bank and saw Okobi be surrounded by the involved deputies near a “No U-Tum” sign in the middle
of El Camino Real. Khalid said even though he was surrounded, Decedent Okobi continued to
push the deputies. Khalid said she did not see when Decedent Okobi was eventually taken into
custody or what happened afterward as she had returned to her work.

Statement of Witness: Gia Ferrera

Detective Ordone interviewed Gia Ferrer at the Offices of Dr. Ankur Parikh, DDS located at 1490
El Camino Real, Millbrae. Ferrer, an employee of the dental offices, was at her desk facing El
Camino Real when she observed lights from police vehicles across El Camino Real near the Tri
Counties Bank. Ferrer observed a male subject running from Sheriff's Deputies. Ferrer described
the subject as approximately 5’10” to 6’0” tall and approximately 350 pounds wearing a blue shirt
and dark pants (Decedent Okobi). Ferrer saw approximately six (6) deputies attempting to contact
Decedent Okobi and described Okobi as resisting arrest and wandering in and out of traffic. Ferrer
observed one (1) deputy deploy his Taser at Okobi and described seeing the Taser wires on
Decedent Okobi after the use of the device. Ferrer said Decedent Okobi fell and stayed on the
ground for approximately thirty (30) seconds before getting back to his feet. Ferrer heard several
different deputies yell “stop” an estimated twelve (12) times beginning when Decedent Okobi was
running until after the deployment of the Taser. Ferrer said she could hear Decedent Okobi say
“No, no, no” throughout the entire incident.

Ferrer said Decedent Okobi ran into traffic on the north side of El Camino Real and described on-
coming traffic as having to stop with the involved deputies having to hold their hands up to signal
the drivers of the vehicles to stop. Ferrer said she observed one (1) deputy strike Decedent Okobi
around the area of his stomach with a baton; however, Decedent Okobi appeared to not be phased
by the strike. Ferrer described herself as being shocked Okobi did not go down from the baton
strike and being surprised by how much energy Okobi had. Ferrer said one (1) of the deputies
wrapped decedent Okobi in a “hug” which caused them both to fall to the ground. Ferrer said one
(1) of the deputies struck his own head on the ground during the fall. Ferrer described the other
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 6
involved deputies as coming over to assist in detaming Decedent Okobi and said the deputies
appeared to be struggling and having a hard time in trying to detain Okobi. Ferrer had a difficult
time seeing all the activity once the involved deputies were on top of Decedent Okobi but described
seeing Decedent Okobi on both his stomach and back at various times during the struggle and
seeing Okobi attempting to get up. Ferrer described Decedent Okobi as continuing to fight, resist
and making attempts to get up while the deputies attempted to hold Okobi down. Ferrer did not
see Decedent Okobi being handcuffed and next recalled paramedics having arrived on the scene
and conducting CPR on Okobi. Ferrer described approximately 25 to 30 minutes elapsing between
the beginning of the incident to the tume when the ambulance left the scene.

Statement of Witness: Dennis Barboza

In accordance with the Officer-Involved Critical Incident (OICI) Protocol Detective Josh Russell
of the Menlo Park Police Department responded to assist with the interviewing of witnesses in this
investigation. Detective Russell interviewed Dennis Barboza on October 3, 2018 at his business
(Sun Trenz Tanning Salon) located at 1486 El Camino Real, Millbrae.

Barboza said he was behind the front desk at his business when he heard a police siren. Barboza
said he looked outside and saw a black male out on the street corner (Decedent Okobi). Barboza
said he heard a second siren and got up from his seat to looked outside, where he saw Decedent
Okobi carrying two (2) backpacks walking southbound on the west side walk for El Camino Real.
Barboza described Decedent Okobi as a “big guy” and said Okobi was “mumbling”. Barboza
described Decedent Okobi as walking toward two (2) deputies who were smaller in stature,
appearing as if he was going to move the two (2) deputies out of his way. Barboza saw Decedent
Okobi had removed his backpack and raised his hands when deputies deployed a Taser at him.
Barboza said Decedent Okobi fell forward and was on the ground “mumbling” with his arms
outstretched. Barboza said the involved deputies approached Decedent Okobi and told him several
times to get on his stomach. Barboza said Decedent Okobi got back up and may have been
subjected to the Taser again as he fell back to the ground. Barboza said Decedent Okobi got up
again and began “loping” across the center median of El Camino Real toward Barboza’s business.
Barboza was able to see Decedent Okobi’s face and said he though Okobi looked like he was either
“high” or mentally handicapped.

Barboza said the involved deputies began to “grapple” with Decedent Okobi and he recalled seeing
an Asian deputy (Deputy Joshua Wang) and Okobi both fall to the ground. Barboza said five (5)
deputies were on top of Decedent Okobi on the ground and he recalled seeing one (1) deputy take
out “mace” and sprayed Okobi with it. Barboza said he heard one (1) of the other deputies get up
from the group and state he could not see. Barboza said he could see Deputy Joshua Wang had a
cut near his eye and could hear a deputy say “give me your hands” several times and heard a deputy
say “give me your handcuffs”. Barboza recalled seeing Decedent Okobi sitting upright, leaning
against the legs of a deputy. Barboza described Decedent Okobi as drooling and having his head

down toward his chest. Barboza described paramedics as having arrived and administermg CPR
to Decedent Okobi.

Statement of Witness: Kirankumar Patel

Detective Russell interviewed Kirankumar Patel on October 3, 2018 at the Days Inn located at
1550 El Camino Real, Millbrae. Patel, a desk manager for the Day’s Inn said he was out front of
the hotel when he observed a man (Decedent Okobi) crossing the busy El Camino Real. Patel said
a deputy attempted to stop Decedent Okobi, but Okobi did not stop. Patel described the deputy as
attempting to stop Decedent Okobi from entering the roadway and said one (1) deputy alone could
not handle Decedent Okobi so more deputies arrived. Patel described Decedent Okobi as appearing
to be in the mood to fight and waving his hands. Patel said one (1) of the deputies “shot” something
and Decedent Okobi fell to the ground and seemed to Patel to be unconscious. Patel said Decedent
Okobi got up and was moving around again as other deputies arrived on scene. Patel said Decedent
Okobi appeared to still be uncooperative. Patel said the involved deputies were able to surround
Decedent Okobi and said he did not know what the deputies did but noted Okobi again appeared
to him to be unconscious. Patel said Decedent Okobi was repeatedly saying “no” and the deputies
were repeatedly saying “stop” during the incident.

Patel allowed Detective Russell to review the hotel’s video surveillance footage, which captured
a limited view of the attempts by Deputy Wang to conduct a pedestrian stop of Decedent Okobi.
Detective Russell obtained a copy of the video footage.

Statement of Witness: Nicole Basurto

On October 5, 2018 Senior Inspector Bill Massey conducted an interview via telephone with
witness Nicole Basurto. Basurto stated her belief that media reports which stated Decedent
Chinedu Okobi died were incorrect. Basurto stated she was “fairly certain that he died on the
scene.” Basurto said that after Decedent Okobi was “brought to the ground, police officers tried
to sit him up and he was unresponsive.” Basurto said she could see that the subject was
“unconscious” and she could recall Sheriffs Deputies leaving Decedent Okobi in a “sitting
position, against the legs of an officer.” Basurto said Decedent Okobi’s body was “completely
limp” at that time.

Nicole Basurto said her belief the Decedent Okobi was unconscious but wasn’t certain if Okobi’s
heart had stopped or if it was about to. Basurto stated a man, whom she believed may have been
the owner of the tanning salon nearby brought the deputies a bottle or bottles of water and the
deputies splashed Decedent Okobi in the face with water and Okobi did not respond. Basurto said
a few minutes passed and paramedics then arrived. Basurto said that she went back into her office
located at Millbrae Dental, 88 Capuchino Drive in Millbrae, CA. Basurto stated watched from the
windows of her office. Basurto said once paramedics arrived, they started checking Decedent

a ns)
JAMIE DRAPER 8
Okobi for a pulse. Basurto said her co-worker told her paramedics ripped open Decedent Okobi’s
shirt which she knew meant they are going to initiate CPR.

Basurto said that she ran back out to the street and saw paramedics had started compressions.
Basurto said she knew paramedic would not start compressions unless a person is not breathing so
she believed Decedent Okobi had “died already”. Basurto said she never saw any of the Sheriff’s
Deputy initiate CPR prior to the arrival of paramedics and did not know if the deputies ever
checked Decedent Okobi for a pulse. Basurto said she felt Decedent Okobi’s heart stopped either
when he was brought to the ground or right before that and felt the deputies should have started
CPR sooner.

Nicole Basurto stated she was arriving back to work after lunch. she stated. Basurto said she was
headed north on El Camino Real, towards Capuchino Drive and her place of work located at
Millbrae Dental Care, 88 Capuchino Drive. Basurto said she pulled up to the intersection of El
Camino Real and Capuchino Drive and was unable to make the left hand turn onto Capuchino
Drive due to on-coming traffic. Basurto stated she began to watch the incident and saw
approximately five to six deputies who were “kind of trying to talk to him.” Basurto said she could
not hear the exchange of words but she could see the body language. Basurto said Decedent Okobi
looked “a little scared” Basurto was unsure if Decedent Okobi had a mental disability or not but
said “I knew he wasn’t totally there”. Basurto stated the deputies “were trying to calm him down”
and described Decedent Okobi as waving his hands in gestures she believed were due to Okobi
not wanting to be touched. Basurto described Decedent Okobi as having voluntarily “got on the
floor”. Basurto thought it was odd the deputies did not try to arrest Decedent Okobi when he was
on the ground and noted she thought Okobi may have been “on drugs” as he had rolled on his back
and the deputies looked “puzzled”. Basurto described this initial activity as having occurred in
front of the Tri Counties Bank across from the ATM. Basurto estimated she was approximately
fifty (50) feet from the location and watching from inside her vehicle.

Basurto recalled seeing Decedent Okobi struggling to get on his feet and was unsure if the deputies
helped Okobi up or not. Once Decedent Okobi was successfully on his feet, Basurto said Okobi
started backing away from the deputies and then turned to jog away from them. Basurto described
Decedent Okobi as “‘a big heavyset man” and she could hear the deputies yelling for Okobi “stop,
get on the floor, get on your stomach”. Basurto said Decedent Okobi was not listening to the
commands and kept running away from the deputies.

Basurto stated Decedent Okobi and the deputies went around the center median for El] Camino and
began moving in a direction toward where she was seated in her car. Basurto feared Decedent
Okobi might try to get in her car, so she made a left hand turn onto Capuchino Drive. Basurto said
she had her windows down when she turned and could hear the sound of a Taser “go off at least
two (2) times”. Basurto said she watched from her review mirror as a deputy (Deputy Joshua
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 9
Wang) had his “baton” out and started to hit Decedent Okobi in the back with the baton, swinging
it “at least two, possibly three” times. Basurto said Decedent Okobi turned and started “swinging”
at Deputy Wang with what she described as “slapping”. Basurto said Decedent Okobi made contact
with Deputy Wang and they “got into a bit of a scuffle” which resulted in the other deputies
arriving and taking Okobi to the ground. Basurto described Decedent Okobi as being “aggressive
and violent and attacking one of the officers” when deputies brought Okobi to the ground. Basurto
said she parked near the Tri Counties Bank, exited her vehicle and watched the activity further
while on Capuchino Drive.

Basurto described seeing approximately six (6) to seven (7) deputies around Decedent Okobi when
he was brought to the ground. Basurto described a male deputy as having hit Decedent Okobi three
(3) to four (4) times with a closed fist. Basurto could not be certain where on Okobi’s body the
hits were being directed but thought they “seemed to be his head’. Basurto felt these “hits” were
unnecessary since Decedent Okobi was already being “pinned” to the ground. Basurto said she
understood why deputies felt they needed to have so many deputies holding Decedent Okobi down
since he as “a heavier set man, he was tall, he was a big guy” but she felt personally that there was
no need to use so many deputies.

Statement of Witness: Joseph Gonzales (Community Service Officer)
Community Service Officer Joseph Gonzales with the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office was
interviewed by Senior Inspector Rich Maher on October 5, 2018 at the District Attorney’s Office.

Joseph Gonzales has been employed by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office as a Community
Service Officer (CSO) for just over two (2) years. CSO Gonzales is assigned to the Millbrae Patrol
Bureau working a 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM shift Monday through Wednesday. CSO Gonzales’
assigned duties include parking enforcement, traffic control, handling abandoned vehicles and the
intake of property.

CSO Gonzales was on-duty and in full uniform on October 3, 2018 and was driving Sheriffs
Office vehicle #15, an unmarked Ford F150 pick-up truck. The truck is equipped with emergency
lights to assist with traffic control. CSO Gonzales was wearing a light blue San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office shirt, navy blue color cargo style pants, a black duty belt and black boots. He
confirmed that his uniform shirt has Sheriff’s Office shoulder patches, and a “Community Service
Officer” badge and name tag on his chest.

CSO Gonzales said he heard an initial radio call from Deputy Wang requesting another officer and
hearing Deputy Wang later ask for “Code-3”. CSO Gonzales said since the call originated as a
“person running through traffic on El Camino” he responded from the Millbrae Substation to assist
with any possible traffic control which might be required. CSO Gonzales said upon arrival, he
could see Deputy Bryan Watt, Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti, Deputy Joshua Wang and Sergeant David
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 10
Weidner in the southbound lanes of El Camino Real. CSO Gonzales activated his emergency lights
and repositioned his vehicle at an angle to try and block the northbound lanes of El Camino Real.

CSO Gonzales remained in his vehicle as the group of deputies moved towards his location in
pursuit of the man (Decedent Chinedu Okobi). CSO Gonzales said the deputies were yelling at
Decedent Okobi to stop as they followed him over the center median. CSO Gonzales could not
recall exactly what was being yelled by the deputies but said it was clear to him they were trying
to get Decedent Okobi to stop. CSO Gonzales described Decedent Okobi as being a large black
man, with scuff on his face, and wearing a blue shirt. CSO Gonzales estimated Decedent Okobi
was over 6’ tall and between 240 to 250 Ibs.

CSO Gonzales looked to his right side briefly to check for traffic and looked back to see the
deputies had tripped or fallen to the ground and were struggling with Decedent Okobi to the rear
of his vehicle. CSO Gonzales exited his vehicle to help the deputies in their attempts to control
Decedent Okobi. CSO Gonzales said he grabbed Decedent Okobi’s right arm and hand to keep
Okobi from striking the deputies. CSO Gonzales said he held Decedent Okobi’s right arm securely
to his own chest. CSO Gonzales said he could not recall exactly what was being said but did recall
the involved deputies were telling Decedent Okobi to stop resisting and to put his hands behind
his back. CSO Gonzales said he was not sure if pepper spray was deployed during the incident but
did see several of the involved deputies backing away from the struggle to control Decedent Okobi
and noted they appeared to be suffering from pepper spray exposure. CSO Gonzales said Deputy
Watt was one (1) of the deputies who appeared to have been exposed to pepper spray. CSO
Gonzales said Deputy Watt handed him a pair of handcuffs which he intended to use to assist in
handcuffing Decedent Okobi, but the other deputies were successful in getting Okobi handcuffed
without his help.

CSO Gonzales said once Decedent Okobi was handcuffed, the deputies sat Okobi up on his rear
end. CSO Gonzales said he left to get water for the deputies effected by pepper spray but said
when he left the immediate area, Decedent Okobi was conscious, awake, breathing, and looking
around. CSO Gonzales said Decedent Okobi was sitting upright but appeared “out of it”.

CSO Gonzales said medics were called to the scene and he thought they had been called because
of the pepper spray exposure and because Deputy Wang had suffered a significant cut on his face.
CSO Gonzales said Sergeant Weidner assigned him to stop traffic and redirect the passing vehicles.
CSO Gonzales said he never realized there was anything wrong with Decedent Okobi. CSO
Gonzales said he knew that when anyone is tased, medics are called to access them, so he didn’t
think there was anything significant about medics being present. CSO Gonzales said fire
department personnel were “working” on Decedent Okobi (administering chest compression) as
he was being transported to the ambulance but thought Okobi was alright once he had been placed
on the ambulance.
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 11
CSO Gonzales said he did not see Decedent Okobi get tased but did see a taser prong and taser
wires when he was restraining the man’s hand and arm. CSO Gonzales thought the prong might
have been in Decedent Okobi’s right arm or the right side of Okobi’s chest.

When asked why he got out of his vehicle, CSO Gonzales stated, “It was just a reaction. I saw that
the team was struggling, um, I saw that they were not able to apprehend him, and I saw that his
right hand was flailing.” CSO Gonzales said he feared the deputies would not be able to establish
control over Decedent Okobi. CSO Gonzales described Decedent Okobi as flailing his right arm
and hand at Deputy Wang while Deputy Wang was grabbing Okobi around the body. CSO
Gonzales said Deputy Wang was struck by Decedent Okobi with both open and closed hand
strikes. CSO Gonzales said Decedent Okobi was “fighting” with five people and the five people
were not able to stop Okobi. CSO Gonzales noted there were people out on the street watching
and traffic was still moving; so, he didn’t know what might happen if Decedent Okobi got up and
continued down the street.

STATEMENTS OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL

In accordance with the Officer-Involved Critical Incident (OICI) Protocol and the countywide San
Mateo OICI Response Team, members of the Daly City Police Department interviewed the
emergency medical personnel that responded to the 1400 block of El Camino Real on October 3,
2018. In response to the request by the involved deputies for emergency medical services to
respond to the scene, Fire Engine #37 from the Central San Mateo County Fire Department, Fire
Engine #51 of the San Bruno Fire Department, and American Medical Response (AMR)
ambulances # 39 and 94 all responded to the scene to aid in the treatment of decedent Chinedu
Okobi, Deputy Joshua Wang, Deputy Bryan Watt and Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti.

Detective Joshua McQuade and Detective Brandon Scholes from the Daly City Police Department
conducted interviews with a total of twelve (12) Firefighters, Paramedics and Emergency Medical
Technicians (EMT) who were present at the scene and involved in the treatment of Decedent Okobi
and the involved deputies. The following is a summary of interviews conducted by Detective
McQuade and Detective Scholes:

Statement of Fire Captain Thomas Donnelly:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Thomas Donnelly on October 3, 2018.
Captain Donnelly is a Fire Captain for the Central San Mateo County Fire Department and was
part of the response to the scene on Engine #37. Captain Donnelly said he spoke with an
unidentified Sheriff's Deputy (Sergeant David Weidner) who directed his attention toward a
handcuffed subject (Decedent Okobi) and informed Captain Donnelly that Okobi had been tased
twice during an altercation. Captain Donnelly said Decedent Okobi was in a seated, upright
position being supported at the back by the legs of a Sheriff's Deputy. Sergeant Weidner informed

JAMIE DRAPER 12
Captain Donnelly that three (3) Sheriff's Deputies had been exposed to pepper spray. Captain
Donnelly said he requested another fire engine and a Battalion Chief to respond to the scene.

Captain Donnelly said he assigned one (1) of his firefighter-paramedics to attend to Decedent
Okobi and the other firefighter paramedic to attend to two (2) Deputies who had been exposed to
pepper spray. Captain Donnelly said one of the Sheriff's Deputies (Deputy Joshua Wang) appeared
to have visible trauma on his face. Captain Donnelly said he did not observe any visible injuries
on Decedent Okobi and assumed Okobi was breathing as his firefighter-paramedic assessed Okobi
and did not notify him Okobi was in full arrest. Captain Donnelly said after the arrival of San
Bruno Fire Department, Engine #51 he learned Decedent Okobi had gone into “full arrest”. When
Decedent Okobi went into full arrest, firefighter-paramedic Mark Mazza ceased providing medical
treatment to Deputy Wang and assisted with attending to Decedent Okobi. Captain Donnelly said
medical personnel continued to provide life saving measures on Decedent Okobi, placed him in an
ambulance, and transported him to the hospital.

part of the response to the scene on Engine #37. Firefighter Mazza said he was assigned by Captain
Donnelly to attend to the injuries of Deputy Joshua Wang. Firefighter Mazza said he observed a
subject in-custody (Decedent Okobi) who was seated upright on the pavement with one (1) or two
(2) Sheriff's Deputies propping up Okobi’s back. Firefighter Mazza said he was approximately
fifteen (15) feet from Decedent Okobi and could see Okobi was moving, his abdomen was rising
and falling as if Okobi was inhaling and exhaling.

Firefighter Mazza said Deputy Wang appeared to him to be “dazed” and had several lacerations to
the left side of the face. Firefighter Mazza said Deputy Wang told him he had been hit in the face
and had his face “grabbed” by Decedent Okobi. Firefighter Mazza said he applied a blood pressure
cuff to Deputy Wang and went to retrieve sterile water from the fire engine to provide to the
deputies who had been exposed to pepper spray. Firefighter Mazza said upon returning to Deputy
Wang’s location, a firefighter-paramedic attending to Decedent Okobi yelled to firefighter Mazza
he needed the blood pressure machine. Firefighter Mazza saw medical personnel had begun
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Decedent Okobi. Firefighter Mazza said he brought the
blood pressure machine over and began assisting in the treatment of Decedent Okobi. Firefighter
Mazza said as they were preparing the subject for an Intraosseous Infusion into the bone marrow
in the subject’s shin, he heard the “flatline” on the blood pressure machine. Firefighter Mazza
assisted in preparing an Epinephrine injection and ultimately assisted in placing Decedent Okobi
on a gurney for transportation to the hospital.

Statement of Firefighter-Paramedic David Novelli:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with David Novelli on October 3, 2018. David
Novelli is a firefighter-paramedic with the Central San Mateo County Fire Department and was
part of the response to the scene on Engine #37. Firefighter Novelli said he observed an injured
Sheriff's Deputy (Deputy Wang) who had abrasions on the left side of his face. Firefighter Novelli
said he saw Decedent Okobi seated on the ground with his back being propped up by two (2)
Sheriffs Deputies. Firefighter Novelli said a paramedic from AMR arrived on scene and together
they assessed Decedent Okobi for his level of alertness. Firefighter Novelli said Decedent Okobi
did not respond so he and the AMR paramedic both checked Okobi for a pulse and agreed he had
one. Firefighter Novelli said while checking the subject’s pulse, Decedent Okobi shook his head
back and forth twice. Firefighter Novelli said the scene was chaotic so they elected to move
Decedent Okobi to the back of an ambulance. Firefighter Novelli said by the time the AMR
paramedic returned with a gumey and stretcher, they noted a change in Decedent Okobi’s
appearance and checked his pulse again. Firefighter Novelli said they were unable to locate a pulse
and initiated CPR.

Firefighter Novelli said he relinquished the scene to paramedic-intern from San Bruno Fire Engine
#51 and continued with providing CPR to Decedent Okobi. Firefighter Novelli said he contacted
Deputy Wang after the first round of CPR was complete to get a better idea of what transpired.
Firefighter Novelli said Deputy Wang told him he deployed his Taser and pressed the Taser trigger
two (2) to three (3) more times. Deputy Wang also told firefighter Novelli he had thought another
deputy may have also deployed their Taser and that “OC spray” (pepper spray) may also have been
utilized.

Firefighter Novelli returned to attending to Decedent Okobi and cut off Okobi’s clothing.
Firefighter Novelli said he saw no visible injuries on Decedent Okobi other than a Taser probe in
Okobi’s chest just to the right of his stemum. Firefighter Novelli said Decedent Okobi did not
make any statements or speak at any time. Firefighter Novelli said he returned to the fire engine
to retrieve additional equipment and when he returned, other medical personnel were putting
Decedent Okobi on a gurmey and loading him into an ambulance. Firefighter Novelli said he
transitioned to treating Deputy Wang and went to Mills-Peninsula Hospital in the back of AMR
unit 94 with Deputy Wang. Firefighter Novelli said Deputy Wang complained of pain to the left
side of his face, the right side of his neck and his right wrist. Firefighter Novelli said the lacerations
on Deputy Wang’s face did not appear to be “deep” and were no longer actively bleeding when he
treated him.

Statement of Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Ferdinand Retanubun:
Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Ferdinand Retanubun on October 3, 2018.
Ferdinand Retanubun is an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) for American Medical
Response (AMR) and was assigned to ambulance #94. EMT Retanubun said he saw a subject

JAMIE DRAPER 14
(Decedent Okobi) on the ground near a gumey with his hands handcuffed behind his back. EMT
Retanubun said Decedent Okobi was motionless and he heard someone say, “check to see if he’s
breathing”. EMT Retanubun said his unit was assigned to treat the injured deputy who was
bleeding from the face (Deputy Wang). EMT Retanubun said he was walking Deputy Wang to
their ambulance to treat his injuries when he saw the other medical personnel on the scene were
applying life saving measures on Decedent Okobi and assumed Okobi had gone into cardiac arrest.
EMT Retanubun went to assist in rendering aid to Decedent Okobi and left Deputy Wang with
paramedic Patrick Pham.

EMT Retanubun eventually relieved another medic at the scene and took over administering CPR
to Decedent Okobi. EMT Retanubun said Decedent Okobi was attached to an ECG machine and
did not have a pulse while he was administering CPR. EMT Retanubun said Decedent Okobi was
eventually loaded into AMR ambulance #37 and transported to the hospital. Because he had been
the one applying CPR to Decedent Okobi at the time, EMT Retanubun rode in the ambulance with
Okobi and was able to confirm medical aid was provided to Decedent Okobi the entire way to the
hospital. EMT Retanubun said he did not see any visible injuries on Decedent Okobi other than a
Taser probe stuck in the right side of Okobi’s chest.

Statement of Paramedic Patrick Pham:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Patrick Pham on October 3, 2018. Patrick
Pham is a Paramedic for American Medical Response (AMR) and was assigned to ambulance #94.
Pham said he was assigned to attend to two (2) Sheriff's Deputies whom he described as an Asian
deputy with abrasions to his face (Deputy Joshua Wang) and a bald deputy who had been exposed
to pepper spray (Deputy Bryan Watt). Paramedic Pham said Deputy Wang was being treated by a
firefighter when he arrived, so he did not get a good look at the injuries, which he described as a
laceration on the left side of Deputy Wang’s face. Paramedic Pham said he saw a shirtless subject
on his back on the ground (Decedent Okobi) being treated by a paramedic. Paramedic Pham said
he overheard somebody say Decedent Okobi did not have a pulse and CPR was initiated on Okobi.
Paramedic Pham said he never heard Decedent Okobi say anything while he was on scene and did
not observe any injuries on Okobi. Paramedic Pham said he observed the medical personnel
treating Decedent Okobi and saw they placed Okobi on a monitor, provided CPR, ventilation, and
administered Epinephrine.

Statement of Paramedic-Intern Gabriel Richardson:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Gabriel Richardson on October 3, 2018.

time he was attending to him.

Statement of Firefighter Paramedic Michael Paulin:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Michael Paulin on October 3, 2018.
Michael Paulin is a firefighter-paramedic with the San Bruno Fire Department and was part of the
response to the scene on Engine #51. Firefighter Paulin said he was assigned to prepare an
intravenous line for the subject (Decedent Okobi) who was being treated at the scene. Firefighter
Paulin said he established an intravenous line and determined it was flowing properly before being
tasked with providing resuscitative medicine through the line. Firefighter Paulin said he provided
two (2) doses of Epinephrine to Decedent Okobi during treatment and did not provide any other
medications. Firefighter Paulin said he also assisted another paramedic in establishing an airway
on Decedent Okobi and assisted in placing Okobi on a gurmey and into an ambulance. Firefighter
Paulin said he did not see any visible injuries on Decedent Okobi and did not hear Okobi say
anything because the subject was in full arrest when he arrived. Firefighter Paulin said he assisted
in attending to an injured deputy who appeared to have a laceration or abrasion on his head (Deputy
Wang) but did not hear any details from Deputy Wang about what had occurred.

Statement of Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) Suzanne Holman:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Suzanne Holman on October 4, 2018.
Suzanne Holman is an Emergency Medical Technician for American Medical Response (AMR)
and was assigned to ambulance #37. EMT Holman stated she observed a subject in a seated
position (Decedent Okobi) being propped up by a Deputy who was standing directly behind Okobi
when she arrived. EMT Holman observed a firefighter-paramedic check Decedent Okobi for a
pulse and state he felt a “weak one”. EMT Holman said the same firefighter-paramedic conducted
a sternum rub on Decedent Okobi and Okobi did not appear to respond. EMT Holman said she
was assigned to prepare her ambulance for “trauma transport” and was later instructed to get
breathing equipment ready because Decedent Okobi had gone in to full cardiac arrest. EMT
Holman said upon returning from the ambulance, she saw CPR had been initiated on Decedent
Okobi. EMT Holman said she never heard Decedent Okobi make any statements and said Okobi
was completely unresponsive when she was present. EMT Holman noted Decedent Okobi had a
Taser probe still lodged in his “right flank” and noted Okobi had several scrapes on his hands and
a few abrasions on his back. EMT Holman did not know if the scratches and abrasions occurred
during CPR or if they were there previously. EMT Holman said she transported Decedent Okobi
to the hospital in AMR #37 and confirmed life saving measures were provided during the entire
drive to the hospital. EMT Holman said she overheard conversations about how Decedent Okobi
had been combative and that it took multiple deployments of a Taser to get him into custody.

Statement of Paramedic Forrest Uhland:

Detective Joshua McQuade conducted an interview with Forrest Uhland on October 4, 2018.
Forrest Uhland is a Paramedic for American Medical Response (AMR) and was assigned to
ambulance #37. Paramedic Uhland said he first noticed a Sheriff's Deputy with a “massive scrape”
on his face (Deputy Joshua Wang) which was bleeding when he arrived. Paramedic Uhland said
he was going to attend to Deputy Wang, but saw a subject seated on the ground, slumped over and
drooling (Decedent Okobi). Paramedic Uhland said he went to check Decedent Okobi for a pulse
at the carotid artery and was told by a firefighter already with Okobi “yup, we’ve got a pulse”.
Paramedic Uhland said Decedent Okobi was moving when he first saw him; however, said after a
few minutes, everyone around Decedent Okobi noted he was no longer responding. Paramedic
Uhland said the change in Decedent Okobi was “night and day”. Paramedic Uhland said Decedent
Okobi was checked again for a pulse, but they could not feel one. Paramedic Uhland said Decedent
Okobi was placed on his back on the ground with his hands still behand his back when they
initiated CPR. Paramedic Uhland said he coordinated the scene and did not render any medical aid
to Decedent Okobi personally. Paramedic Uhland did observe a firefighter maintaining an airway
on Decedent Okobi, another applying chest compressions, and a third one establishing an
intravenous line in Okobi’s shin. Paramedic Uhland said Decedent Okobi received two (2) doses
of Epinephrine at the scene, Okobi did not ever regain consciousness and his heart rate never
changed from the initial “flat-lined” reading. Paramedic Uhland said due to the cardiac arrest being
witnessed by them, Decedent Okobi was transported to the hospital in AMR #37. During
transportation to the hospital, Paramedic Uhland said Decedent Okobi received two (2) more doses
of Epinephrine and life saving measures were conducted the entire drive.

Paramedic Uhland said he saw visible scrapes on Decedent Okobi’s knuckles and hands but felt
these injuries may have gotten worse during CPR since Okobi was still handcuffed with his hands
behind him. Paramedic Uhland described Decedent Okobi as looking “drunk out of his mind”.
Paramedic Uhland did observe one (1) Taser prong in Decedent Okobi’s right chest area and saw
a copper wire underneath Okobi when he was laying on his back. Paramedic Uhland said he also
noted the presence of the injured Sheriff's Deputy (Deputy Wang) and noted dried blood on
Deputy Wang’s face. Paramedic Uhland said the injury looked to him as if someone had “clawed”
Deputy Wang on the left side of his face. Paramedic Uhland stated when he observed Deputy
Wang and his injuries, he thought to himself “Man, he’s been through it. They really fought”.

STATEMENTS OF INVOLVED OFFICERS:

Statement of Deputy Joshua Wang:
Deputy Joshua Wang was interviewed by Inspector Rick Decker on October 4, 2018 at the San
Mateo County District Attorney’s Office. Present for this interview was Deputy Wang’s attorney
Zebulon Davis with Mastagni Holstedt, APC. At the request of Deputy Wang and Mastagni
Holstedt, APC Deputy Wang reviewed footage from his Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recorder as
|
JAMIE DRAPER ay
well as the video footage captured by witness Robert Garrison. The audio for Garrison’s video
footage was removed prior to Deputy Wang viewing the video.

Deputy Joshua Wang has been employed as a Deputy Sheriff with the San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office for approximately eight (8) months. Prior to employment with the Sheriff's Office, Deputy
Wang was employed as a police officer with the San Francisco Police Department. During his time
with the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, Deputy Wang has been assigned to the Patrol Bureau.
While employed with the San Francisco Police Department, Deputy Wang was assigned to the
Patrol Division and to the Specialist Team which would respond to in-progress critical incidents,
assist the SWAT team with high-risk search warrants and work security details for gatherings and
protests.

On October 3, 2018 Deputy Wang was assigned to work patrol out of the Millbrae Patrol Bureau,
working a normally scheduled 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM patrol shift. Deputy Wang was driving San
Mateo County Sheriff’s Office vehicle #10, a fully marked Ford Explorer police vehicle equipped
with functioning code-3 lighting equipment and a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system.
Deputy Wang was wearing a full, long-sleeved wool police uniform with Sheriff's Office patches
affixed to both shoulders and a metal badge and metal name tag affixed to the chest. Deputy Wang
did not utilize an external ballistic vest carrier and carried all equipment on his duty belt.

Deputy Wang worked an overtime patrol shift assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau on October
2, 2018, working the same 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM shift as his normal work schedule. On October 3,
2018 Deputy Wang was driving his patrol vehicle southbound on El Camino Real, approaching
the intersection of Millwood Drive when he observed a male subject (Decedent Okobi) walking
eastbound on Millwood crossing El Camino Real while the light was green for southbound traffic
on El Camino Real. Deputy Wang decided to conduct a traffic stop, activated his overhead
emergency lighting equipment and conducted a U-turn to contact Decedent Okobi. Deputy Wang
described Decedent Okobi as an “African-American male, fairly large in statute, carrying
numerous bags”. Deputy Wang said he pulled alongside Decedent Okobi and said something like
“Hey I need to talk to you” or “Hey, stop. Hold on for a minute”. Deputy Wang said Decedent
Okobi ignored him and continued walking north along El Camino Real. Deputy Wang said he
drove past Decedent Okobi and attempted to exit his vehicle and contact Okobi on foot. Deputy
Wang said Decedent Okobi was walking in the lanes of traffic, creating a hazard for oncoming
traffic. Deputy Wang stated, “I was bound to this subject now” and “I thought I can’t just drive
away. Now he’s walking in traffic. He may get struck by a vehicle Um, he may cause an accident”.

Deputy Wang said he notified San Mateo County Public Safety Communications he was
attempting to conduct a pedestrian stop and needed assistance. Deputy Wang said he believed he
would need assistance in safely contacting the subject in the busy roadway given the high volume
of traffic at the time. Deputy Wang described Decedent Okobi as walking within the northbound
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 18
traffic lanes, on the center median, and veering into the southbound lanes. Deputy Wang said
Decedent Okobi was causing a traffic hazard by causing cars to maneuver around Okobi to keep
from hitting him. Deputy Wang said, “it seemed he had no regard for his own safety or the safety
of other people that were in the roadway”. Deputy Wang stated the fact Decedent Okobi was
walking in the roadway for an extended period was creating an “exigent public safety” matter and
noted Okobi continued to ignore his constantly activated emergency lighting equipment.

Deputy Wang said he was preparing to make a U-turn southbound on El Camino Real to re-
approach Decedent Okobi who was now travelling southbound when he saw multiple Sheriff's
Office vehicles approaching the subject “code-3”. Deputy Wang saw Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti
arrive and exit her patrol vehicle. Deputy Wang saw Deputy Lorenzatti approach Decedent Okobi
and make a “forceful” hand motion he interpreted as Deputy Lorenzatti ordering Okobi to the
ground or ordering him to drop his bags. Deputy Wang also saw Deputy John DeMartini arrive
and join Deputy Lorenzatti. Deputy Wang said he became concerned for the safety of both officers
as Decedent Okobi was clearly much larger than both deputies and would possibly be able to
overpower them if the altercation escalated to some type of physical altercation”. Deputy Wang
saw both Deputy Lorenzatti and Deputy DeMartini attempt to grab Decedent Okobi’s arms;
however, Okobi was able to pull away from their grasp. Deputy Wang exited his own patrol car
and ran toward Decedent Okobi and grabbed Okobi’s right hand to move the arm to the small of
Okobi’s back in a control hold. Deputy Wang said he was not able to get the subject’s hand behind
his back because “his level of resistance was much stronger than my level of force and I could tell
quickly I wasn’t going to be able to physically gain control of him myself”. When asked why he
wanted to detain Decedent Okobi in handcuffs, Deputy Wang said “his behavior was
unpredictable. He would not acknowledge any of my commands. He had already — like I said
earlier, displayed pre-indications that he was trying to evade detention by - by creating distance
between myself and him and based on his physical stature, I thought in order to prevent him from
attacking us, I felt safer in having him in handcuffs before we try to engage in some kind of
meaningful dialogue”.

Deputy Wang said he unholstered his Taser to “try another force option beyond physical control”.
Deputy Wang said he deactivated the thumb safety on the Taser, aimed the device at Decedent
Okobi’s chest and stated, “If you don’t comply. Or don’t get on the ground then you’ll get Tased”.
Deputy Wang said Decedent Okobi ignore him, so he deployed his Taser. Deputy Wang believed
the Taser was effective in that he saw Decedent Okobi experience “some discomfort”
and believed Okobi fell to the ground. After the Taser deployment, Deputy Wang said he notified
county communications of the Taser deployment and to have paramedics respond and stage per
San Mateo County Sheriff's Office policy. Deputy Wang said the other involved deputies on scene
tried unsuccessfully to detain Decedent Okobi while he was on the ground. Deputy Wang noted
Decedent Okobi continued to resist commands to get on his stomach. Because of the continued
resistance and refusal to comply, Deputy Wangs activated his Taser a second time while the Taser
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 19
probes were still attached to Decedent Okobi. Deputy Wang said he did not believe the second
Taser activation had any effect on Decedent Okobi and did not know if the probes were still
attached to Okobi or not.

Deputy Wang described Decedent Okobi as “still very much agitated, he was speaking
incoherently. He was moving, he was, um very excited” and said Okobi continued to refuse to
comply with orders to roll on to his stomach. Deputy Wang said he activated the Taser, utilizing
the same attached probes, a third time and stated, “I hoped he would just give up and surrender”.
Deputy Wang could not recall if Decedent Okobi showed any effects of the third Taser activation.
Deputy Wang described Decedent Okobi as still “uncompliant” and said Okobi’s body language
never indicated an intent to “surrender”.

Deputy Wang recalled having seen Deputy Bryan Watt attempt to place Decedent Okobi in a
control hold, but Okobi was able to pull away from Deputy Watt. Deputy Wang said he could see
Decedent Okobi was still resisting and believed he activated his Taser for the fourth time, still
using the same probes still attached to Okobi. Deputy Wang said Decedent Okobi continued to
ignore orders from multiple officers and was able to get back up on his feet. Deputy Wang said he
realized at that point his Taser had been “totally ineffective” as a means to detain Decedent Okobi.
Deputy Wang recalled activating the Taser one (1) more time and recalled hearing a “clicking”
sound from the Taser and recalled someone (unknown who) told him to “turn it off”.

Deputy Wang said he discarded his Taser in the roadway and expanded his ASP collapsible baton
with his right hand as Decedent Okobi continued to move away from he and the other involved
deputies while they all moved eastbound across El Camino Real. Deputy Wang said he attempted
to strike Decedent Okobi with the baton by striking toward Okobi’s lower leg, however the baton
did not contact Okobi. Deputy Wang said he then “felt him tackle me” and felt him “grab onto me
and kinda pull me to the ground” Deputy Wang said “I saw something out of the corner of my eye
and I felt like a hot stinging pain on the left side of my face. I didn’t black out but knew something
had hit me on the face”. Deputy Wang said he felt Decedent Okobi pulling on his duty belt while
Deputy Wang was on the ground and recalled having tried to stand up and punch Okobi to try and
defend himself but was not sure if he connected with the punch or not. Deputy Wang then took out
his pepper spray and deployed it at Decedent Okobi’s face but immediately heard the other
involved deputies scream in pain which made him realize he had missed the subject with the pepper
spray.

Deputy Wang said he recalled looking up, or standing up at some point, and seeing Decedent
Okobi had been placed in handcuffs. Deputy Wang said Decedent Okobi was still thrashing about
and the other deputies were trying to prevent Okobi from getting up. Deputy Wang recalled
Decedent Okobi was still “making noises” and was still breathing. Deputy Wang said the other
deputies moved Decedent Okobi into a seated position and he helped support Okobi upright
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 20
utilizing his legs at Okobi’s back. Deputy Wang said someone told him to “go sit down” and he
was relieved from propping up Decedent Okobi. Deputy Wang said he eventually saw CPR being
performed on Decedent Okobi prior to Deputy Wang being escorted to an ambulance after he
realized he was bleeding.

Statement of Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti:

Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti was interviewed by Inspector Eric Suzuki on October 4, 2018 at the San
Mateo County District Attorney’s Office. Present for this interview was Deputy Lorenzatti’s
attorney Zebulon Davis with Mastagni Holstedt, APC. At the request of Deputy Lorenzatti and
Mastagni Holstedt, APC, Deputy Lorenzatti viewed the footage from her Mobile Audio Video
(MAV) recorder as well as the video footage captured by witness Robert Garrison. The audio for
Garrison’s video footage was removed prior to Deputy Lorenzatti viewing the video.

Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti has been employed as a Deputy Sheriff for the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office for approximately two (2) years. Prior to being hired by the Sheriff's Office,
Deputy Lorenzatti was employed as a police officer with the California Highway Patrol (CHP) for
approximately three (3) years.

On October 3, 2018, Deputy Lorenzatti was assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau and was
working her normally assigned 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM shift. Deputy Lorenzatti stated October 3,
2018 was the first day of her work week and she did not respond to any stressful of unusual calls
for service prior to the incident. Deputy Lorenzatti was driving San Mateo County Sheriff's Office
vehicle #8, a fully marked Ford Taurus police vehicle equipped with functioning code-3 lighting
equipment and a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system. Deputy Lorenzatti was wearing
a full, short-sleeved wool police uniform with Sheriff's Office patches affixed to both shoulders
with a metal badge and metal name tag affixed to the chest area. Deputy Lorenzatti did not utilize
an external ballistic vest carrier at the time of this incident.

Deputy Lorenzatti stated she was in the report writing room at the Millbrae Police Substation when
she heard Deputy Joshua Wang broadcast over the radio he was contacting a subject. Deputy
Lorenzatti heard Deputy Wang come over the radio and request “Code 3 cover” and say that
someone was running in traffic in the northbound lanes of traffic for El Camino Real near
Millwood Drive. Deputy Lorenzatti said she ran out to her patrol vehicle and saw Deputy Bryan
Watt and Sergeant David Weidner also going to their respective patrol vehicles. Deputy Lorenzatti
activated her lighting equipment and siren and responded to the scene. Deputy Lorenzatti said
when she arrived in the area, she observed a large black male wearing a blue shirt (Decedent
Okobi) run across the lanes of traffic from northbound El Camino Real to southbound El Camino
Real.

a ns)
JAMIE DRAPER 21
Deputy Lorenzatti said she approached Decedent Okobi’s location by driving northbound in the
southbound lanes of El Camino Real. Deputy Lorenzatti described Decedent Okobi as being over
six (6) feet tall and approximately 300 pounds. Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi was
carrying two (2) large black bags in his hand and was walking southbound on the west sidewalk
of El Camino Real when she first approached him. Deputy Lorenzatti said she told Decedent Okobi
to stop and put the bags he was carrying down. Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi said
something like “I didn’t do nothing” or “I didn’t do anything”. Deputy Lorenzatti said she repeated
her order for Decedent Okobi to stop; however, Decedent Okobi stared directly at Deputy
Lorenzatti and continued to walk straight toward her. Deputy Lorenzatti said she felt like “he was
going to run me over if I didn’t get out of his way.” Deputy Lorenzatti added “he had this look in
his eyes, that he wasn’t quite all there. He seemed like he might have been under the influence of
something. I wasn’t really sure”.

Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi continued to ignore her orders and walk toward her, so
Deputy Lorenzatti said she sidestepped Okobi and attempted to grab his left arm to detain him
based upon Deputy Wang’s radio traffic and Okobi’s lack of acknowledgement of her verbal
commands. Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi pulled away from her attempt at a control hold
and continued to travel past her. Deputy Lorenzatti said she tried a second time to grab Decedent
Okobi’s arm but he flung his arms up in the air away from her. Deputy Lorenzatti said due to
Decedent Okobi’s active resistance of her efforts to detain him, she felt she needed to try and take
Decedent Okobi to the ground to gain better control of him. Deputy Lorenzatti noted Decedent
Okobi was too big to control and her other efforts thus far had been ineffective. Deputy Lorenzatti
said she attempted to sweep Decedent Okobi’s leg to bring him to the ground, but the technique
did not work. Deputy Lorenzatti described Decedent Okobi as waving his arms wildly in the air
and swinging his fists. Deputy Lorenzatti said she heard Deputy Wang tell Decedent Okobi to stop
and warned Decedent Okobi multiple times he would be “tased”.

Deputy Lorenzatti said Deputy Wang deployed his Taser and Decedent Okobi fell to the ground.
Deputy Lorenzatti said she planned on moving in quickly to handcuff Decedent Okobi but when
Okobi fell, he fell away from Deputy Lorenzatti. Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi had
already rolled onto his back by the time she got to him. Deputy Lorenzatti recalled hearing the
involved deputies tell Decedent Okobi multiple times to get on his stomach. Deputy Lorenzatti
said she tried to grab Decedent Okobi’s arm to roll him on his stomach but was unsuccessful.
Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi then attempted to grab her legs. Deputy Lorenzatti said
Decedent Okobi continued to ignore their commands to turn over on to his stomach and recalled
from having watched the videos before the interview that Decedent Okobi was able to get back up
and was tased a second time. Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi fell to the ground again but
was able to get back up quickly and started to run away.

JAMIE DRAPER 22
Deputy Lorenzatti said she saw Deputy Wang get in front of Decedent Okobi and take out his ASP
(collapsible baton). Deputy Lorenzatti said Deputy Wang yelled for Decedent Okobi to stop and
she saw Deputy Wang swing the ASP at the subject; however, she did not see how many times
Deputy Wang swung the ASP nor whether he connected with any of the strikes. Deputy Lorenzatti
said Decedent Okobi appeared fixated on Deputy Wang and she saw Okobi swing at Deputy Wang.
Deputy Lorenzatti did not know if Decedent Okobi hit Deputy Wang with the strike or not. Deputy
Lorenzatti then saw another deputy (she was unable to determine who) tackle Decedent Okobi and
take him to the ground. Deputy Lorenzatti said she then got on top of Decedent Okobi while Okobi
continued to fight, kick, and not provide his hands to deputies despite continued commands to
“Give us your hands, give us your hands. Stop resisting”.

Deputy Lorenzatti said she was hit in the face with pepper spray which was deployed from an
unknown source. Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi was continuing to fight while she was
blinded by the effects of the pepper spray. Deputy Lorenzatti said she put all her body weight on
Decedent Okobi. While trying to control Decedent Okobi, Deputy Lorenzatti said she did punch
Okobi in the lower half of his body to “jolt his arm out” but said her blows were not effective.
Deputy Lorenzatti said she did not ever use her ASP as she feared Decedent Okobi would have
been able to take the ASP away from her given his size and strength. Deputy Lorenzatti recalled
handing her handcuffs to another deputy (unknown to her which one) while she remained
positioned on Decedent Okobi’s lower body until she heard Okobi was handcuffed. Prior to
Decedent Okobi being placed in handcuffs, Deputy Lorenzatti recalled Sergeant Weidner
broadcast a request for medics to be summoned the scene.

Deputy Lorenzatti said that once Decedent Okobi was detained in handcuffs, they rolled Okobi on
to his side and then moved him into a seated position. Deputy Lorenzatti said paramedics arrived
on the scene and she recalled seeing a paramedic determine Decedent Okobi did have a pulse.
Deputy Lorenzatti said at some point, Decedent Okobi stopped responding to pain stimulus and
the paramedics put Decedent Okobi on his back and initiated CPR.

Deputy Lorenzatti said she suffered minor scrapes on her right wrist and right forearm at some
poimt during the struggle with Decedent Okobi; however, did not know when they occurred.
Deputy Lorenzatti was asked if she felt her CIT training could have been used to de-escalate the
situation with Decedent Okobi. Deputy Lorenzatti stated “Everything happened very fast and from
the moment that I got on scene, he wasn’t listening to anything we said, and he was becoming
more and more of a risk as it went on to the public and to us”.

Statement of Sergeant David Weidner:
I conducted an interview with Sergeant David Weidner on October 4, 2018 at the San Mateo
County District Attorney’s Office. Present for this interview was Sergeant Weidner’s attorney
Sarah Burdick with Rains Lucia Stern St. Phalle & Silver, PC. I spoke with Sarah Burdick before

the interview and learned Sergeant Weidner wished to provide a statement based upon his own
memories and perceptions of the incident and did not want to view his Mobile Audio Video (MAV)
footage or the footage captured by witness Robert Garrison prior to his statement.

Sergeant Weidner has been employed as a Deputy Sheriff with the San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office for approximately sixteen and a half (16.5) years. Sergeant Weidner began his career with
the Sheriff's Office as a Correctional Officer, where he served for approximately one and a half
(1.5) years before promoting to Deputy Sheriff. Sergeant Weidner has been a Sheriff's Sergeant
for approximately two (2) years. Prior to his employment with the Sheriff's Office, Sergeant
Weidner was a reserve police officer with the South San Francisco Police Department and worked
as a contractor for the United States Department of State working Federal building security. During
his career with the Sheriff's Office, Sergeant Weidner has been assigned primarily to the Patrol
Division but has also worked in the Corrections and Transportation Divisions. Sergeant Weidner
has been a member of the Sheriff’s Office Range Training staff for approximately ten (10) years
and is currently one of the lead firearms instructors for the Sheriff's Office. Sergeant Weidner is a
certified patrol rifle instructor and is a Taser and pepper spray instructor. Sergeant Weidner has
twice attended Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and has attended multiple courses designed to
aid in the recognition of persons under the influence of a controlled substance.

On October 3, 2018 Sergeant Weidner was assigned as the Day Shift Patrol Sergeant for the
Millbrae Patrol Bureau and was working his normally assigned 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM shift.
Sergeant Weidner said October 3, 2018 would have been the first day of his work week had he not
worked overtime on both of his scheduled days off that week, including an overtime shift in the
Transportation Division working 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM on October 2, 2018. Sergeant Weidner was
driving San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office vehicle #1, a fully marked Ford Explorer police vehicle
equipped with functioning code-3 lighting equipment and a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording
system. The MAV system included a body-worn remote microphone which Sergeant Weidner said
was affixed to chest during the incident. Sergeant Weidner was wearing a full police short-sleeved
uniform with Sheriff's patches and Sergeant chevrons affixed to each sleeve. Sergeant Weidner
was utilizing an exterior ballistic vest carrier at the time of the incident.

Sergeant Weidner stated he was at the Millbrae Police Substation doing administrative work when
he heard Deputy Joshua Wang broadcast over the radio he was attempting to make a pedestrian
stop. As time progressed, Sergeant Weidner recalled hearing Deputy Wang broadcast the subject
had run from him into traffic that Deputy Wang later called for “code three cover”. Sergeant
Weidner said he responded to his patrol vehicle in the back lot of the substation and responded
from the station along with Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti, Deputy John DeMartini and Deputy Bryan
Watt.

Sergeant Weidner said he drove his vehicle northbound in the southbound lanes of traffic of El
Camino Real as he approached the scene in a manner to allow the MAV camera in his patrol
vehicle the best angle to capture the incident. Sergeant Weidner did not recall hearing a description
of the subject being broadcast by Deputy Wang. Upon arriving on the scene, Sergeant Weidner
saw the other deputies attempting to contact a black male adult (Decedent Okobi). Sergeant
Weidner said he first observed Decedent Okobi holding his hands up above his head and saw
Deputy Wang approaching Okobi from behind. Sergeant Weidner said he thought Deputy Wang
would be able to grab Decedent Okobi’s arm and detain him and assumed Okobi was compliant
since his hands were up. Sergeant Weidner said Decedent Okobi pulled his arms down, turned
around and possibly pushed Deputy Wang. Sergeant Weidner said he saw Deputy Wang draw his
Taser, point it at Decedent Okobi and activate his Taser. Sergeant Weidner said he could see
Deputy Wang had gotten an effective Taser deployment and saw Decedent Okobi stagger and fall
over backwards. Sergeant Weidner said he was approximately twenty (20) feet away from Deputy
Wang’s location when Deputy Wang deployed the Taser, but quickly rushed over to cover the
distance when he saw Decedent Okobi fall. Sergeant Weidner said he could see the two (2) Taser
probes in Decedent Okobi’s right forearm and in Okobi’s upper torso on the right side of his body.

Sergeant Weidner stated once Decedent Okobi was on the ground, he noted Okobi appeared to be
under the influence of a controlled substance, likely PCP or “Bath Salts”. Sergeant Weidner based
this assessment on the fact Decedent Okobi was staring straight up into the sky and was “talking
to God”. Sergeant Weidner said he had personally been subjected to a full five (5) second Taser
deployment when he attended Taser instructor school and knew the only physical response
possible from a subject being tased was to either scream or be silent while the device is deploying
a shock. Sergeant Weidner said he moved in to grab Decedent Okobi and roll him over onto his
stomach, but Okobi pulled away from him “like I wasn’t even there”. Sergeant Weidner described
Decedent Okobi as having “super human strength”. Sergeant Weidner further described Decedent
Okobi as having a “thousand-yard stare” and was talking straight up to the sky “like we weren’t
even there”.

Sergeant Weidner said Decedent Okobi “leapt up” and Deputy Wang deployed a second activation
of the Taser by re-engaging the Taser’s trigger and utilizing the same probes. Sergeant Weidner
said this caused Decedent Okobi to fall back down. Sergeant Weidner said he and the other
involved deputies moved in to detain Okobi. Sergeant Weidner said Decedent Okobi continued to
pull away from them because “he was way too strong”. Sergeant Weidner said he observed one
(1) of the Taser wires had broken, so he knew the Taser would be rendered ineffective. Sergeant
Weidner said Decedent Okobi got back up and started to run diagonally across El Camino Real
into the northbound traffic lanes with he and the other involved deputies following. Sergeant
Weidner said Decedent Okobi continued to yell something “incoherent” and “something about
God”. Sergeant Weidner did describe Decedent Okobi as having “a second of clarity” and asking,
“what did I do?” at one point when they were following him.
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 25
Sergeant Weidner said he saw Deputy Wang deploy his ASP (collapsible baton) and swing it at
Decedent Okobi but could not tell if Deputy Wang’s ASP strike hit Okobi or not. Sergeant Weidner
said he could tell Deputy Wang had been struck at this time because he saw Deputy Wang’s ASP
and Taser “literally fly through the air” out of Deputy Wang’s hands. Sergeant Weidner said he
saw Decedent Okobi lower his center of gravity and “basically linebacker tackle” Deputy Wang.
Sergeant Weidner described Decedent Okobi as using both hands to grab toward Deputy Wang’s
legs and put his shoulder into Deputy Wang’s waist. Sergeant Weidner said he could see one (1)
of Decedent Okobi’s hands was on Deputy Wang’s holster and firearm, grasping the top edge of
the holster and the exposed portion of Deputy Wang’s firearm. Sergeant Weidner said he worried
they were going to get into an officer involved shooting and added “we had literally escalated
through our entire use of force”. Sergeant Weidner noted verbal commands, the Taser
deployments, the use of the ASP and ultimately pepper spray as all being ineffective though he did
point out pepper spray had not yet been deployed when he saw Decedent Okobi grasping Deputy
Wang’s holster and firearm.

Sergeant Weidner said Decedent Okobi went to the ground again, but he was unsure what caused
Okobi to fall and speculated Okobi may have tripped. Sergeant Weidner said once Decedent Okobi
was on the ground, he instructed the other deputies to “get on top of him” hoping they could control
Okobi and try to get additional deputies to the scene to assist them. Sergeant Weidner said Deputy
DeMartini was positioned at Decedent Okobi’s feet, Deputy Lorenzatti was at Okobi’s legs and
Sergeant Weidner said he was trying to gain control of Decedent Okobi’s right arm. Sergeant
Weidner said Decedent Okobi’s right forearm was bleeding “pretty profusely” from the Taser
probe, which was still embedded in Okobi’s arm. Sergeant Weidner said this was causing his hands
to keep slipping off Decedent Okobi’s arm as he tried to control it. Sergeant Weidner said pepper
spray was deployed during the struggle with Decedent Okobi. Sergeant Weidner said he found out
afterwards it was Deputy Wang who deployed the pepper spray, but he did not know it was Deputy
Wang during the struggle. Sergeant Weidner speculated the pepper spray nozzle was positioned at
an upward angle and missed Decedent Okobi’s face because the spray instead hit Deputy Watt
with a direct “shot to the face” which incapacitated Deputy Watt and caused him to have to remove
himself from the struggle. Sergeant Weidner said Deputy Lorenzatti also received a direct shot
from the pepper spray and was complaining she could not see and was having difficulty breathing.
Sergeant Weidner said he instructed Deputy Lorenzatti to “hang in there” and “stay in the fight”.
Sergeant Weidner said he was struck with “splash back” from the pepper spray but was not affected
as heavily as Deputy Watt and Deputy Lorenzatti.

Sergeant Weidner said he was able to get Decedent Okobi’s arm out from under him and someone
was able to place a handcuff on Okobi’s wrist. Sergeant Weidner said he called for a second pair
of handcuffs to link together because “there was no way we were getting his hands behind his back
with one pair”. Sergeant Weidner believed Deputy Wang was able to get Decedent Okobi’s other
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 26
arm behind Okobi’s back and someone was able to get Okobi fully handcuffed. Once Decedent
Okobi was successfully in handcuffs, Sergeant Weidner said he immediately became concerned
with the risk of positional asphyxia as they had been on top of Okobi. Sergeant Weidner said he
directed the involved deputies to roll Decedent Okobi on his side and ultimately had them move
him to a seated position. Sergeant Weidner estimated they had Decedent Okobi sitting up within
approximately ten (10) seconds of being handcuffed. Sergeant Weidner said he checked Decedent
Okobi for a pulse once he was in a seated position and described Okobi as initially being “not
responsive” but said Okobi “all the sudden woke up” and was actively looking around.

Sergeant Weidner said he requested over the radio that fire and medical personal who had been
staging near the scene come in to begin treating Decedent Okobi and the deputies. Sergeant
Weidner said he noted Deputy Wang was bleeding “pretty profusely from the face” and wanted to
get him treatment quickly as he did not know the severity of Deputy Wang’s injuries. Sergeant
Weidner said he was focused on establishing a crime scene and obtaining witness statements but
recalled seeing paramedics attending to Decedent Okobi and described Okobi as being alert and
looking around. Sergeant Weidner said Decedent Okobi “then all of the sudden coded” and
recalled a paramedic yelling to a Fire Captain on scene that he needed to get a heart monitor on
Okobi. Sergeant Weidner said the Captain did not hear the paramedic, so he went and relayed the
message. Sergeant Weidner said all the medical personnel on the scene began attending to
Decedent Okobi while Sergeant Weidner began activating the Officer Involved Critical Incident
Protocol.

Sergeant Weidner described Decedent Okobi as “a very big guy” and estimated Okobi to be
approximately six (6) feet or more in height and approximately 300 to 320 pounds in weight.
Sergeant Weidner described having experience in the past with persons under the influence of both
PCP and “Bath Salts” and felt Decedent Okobi was displaying the symptoms of being under the
influence of one (1) of those substances. Sergeant Weidner added his belief that a person under
the influence of PCP or “Bath Salts” and of Decedent Okobi’s size meant there “was no stopping
a man that size”. Sergeant Weidner described one (1) of the key indicators to him Decedent Okobi
was under the influence was the fact Okobi was able to continue talking through a Taser
deployment and added “you can’t do that, okay? That does not happen”. Sergeant Weidner also
based this belief on Decedent Okobi’s lack of responsiveness to pain and “his literally super human
strength”. Sergeant Weidner told me mental health conditions can factor in to the effectiveness of
the Taser, but it was his belief Decedent Okobi was under the influence of a controlled substance.

Sergeant Weidner said he did not utilize any of his own less-lethal weapon options during the
incident. Sergeant Weidner explained he already knew Deputy Wang’s Taser deployment had been
ineffective in incapacitating Decedent Okobi and knew his own Taser would have the same lack
of effect. Sergeant Weidner added his belief the ASP (collapsible baton) would not be an effective
option on a person of Decedent Okobi’s size and knew the next level of escalation would have
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 27
been deadly force, which he was trying to avoid when he instructed the other deputies to get on
top of Okobi once he was on the ground. Sergeant Weidner explained that as a Taser instructor, he
teaches deputies that if one (1) Taser is not working on a subject, the other person’s will not work
either and teaches them not to deploy the Taser in that situation. I asked Sergeant Weidner if he
sustained any injuries during the attempts to take Decedent Okobi into custody. Sergeant Weidner
said he had some soreness in his back and legs from the exertion in attempting to control Decedent
Okobi and was feeling some residual effects of the pepper spray, but he did not seek any medical
attention. Sergeant Weidner also had a scratch on his right hand which he sustained during the
incident.

I talked with Sergeant Weidner about the need to contact someone running in and out of traffic in
this situation. Sergeant Weidner said the behavior sounded to him like a person under the influence
of drugs or alcohol and pointed out running in and out of traffic on a busy roadway such as El
Camino Real made the subject a danger to members of the public and to himself. Sergeant Weidner
added “no normal person runs in and out of traffic”. Sergeant Weidner noted El Camino Real has
a very high volume of traffic and the City of Millbrae has a high occurrence of accidents in which
pedestrians are struck by cars.

Statement of Deputy Bryan Watt:

I conducted an interview with Deputy Bryan Watt on October 5, 2018 at the San Mateo County
District Attorney’s Office. Present for this interview was Deputy Watt’s attorney Gregory
Thoming with Mastagni Holstedt, APC. At the request of Deputy Watt and Mastagni Holstedt,
APC, Deputy Watt viewed footage from his Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recorder as well as video
footage captured by witness Robert Garrison. The audio for Garrison’s video footage was removed
prior to Deputy Watt viewing the video.

Deputy Watt has been employed as a Deputy Sheriff with the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office
for approximately twenty-three (23) years. Deputy Watt served as a Correctional Officer for the
first five (5) years of his career before promoting to the position of Deputy Sheriff eighteen (18)
years ago. Deputy Watt was not employed by any other police agency prior to joining the San
Mateo County Sheriff's Office. During his career with the Sheriff's Office, Deputy Watt has been
assigned primarily to the San Mateo County Jail and the Patrol Bureau. Deputy Watt has attended
a three (3) day course provided by the San Mateo County Narcotics Task Force which provided
training in recognizing subjects under the influence of controlled substances and has also attended
Crisis Intervention Training (CIT).

On October 3, 2018, Deputy Watt was assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau and was working
his normally assigned 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM shift. Deputy Watt stated October 3, 2018 was the first
day of his regular work week; however, he had worked two (2) days of overtime working similar
day shift hours on October 1, 2018 and October 2, 2018. Deputy Watt was driving San Mateo
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 28
County Sheriff's Office vehicle #37, a fully marked Ford Explorer police vehicle equipped with
functioning code-3 lighting equipment and a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system.
Deputy Watt said he reported the body-worn microphone for the MAV in vehicle #37 missing at
the start of his shift. Deputy Watt was wearing a full, short-sleeved police uniform with Sheriff's
Office patches affixed to both shoulders. Deputy Watt said he utilized an extemal ballistic vest
carrier at the time of this incident which had a metal badge and metal name tag affixed to the
exterior of the vest.

Deputy Watt said he was inside the Millbrae Police Substation conducting follow-up on an
unrelated investigation when he heard Deputy Joshua Wang over the police radio asking for an
additional unit. Deputy Watt said Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti was at the substation and he saw her
leave to go respond to cover Deputy Wang. Deputy Watt said he then heard Deputy Wang
broadcast again asking for “code 3 cover”. Deputy Watt said he went to his patrol vehicle and
responded to Deputy Wang’s location “code three”. Deputy Watt said when he arrived on scene,
he saw two (2) to three (3) marked patrol vehicles in the southbound lanes of traffic on El Camino
Real in front of the Tri Counties Bank. Deputy Watt said he first saw an unidentifiable deputy
already on scene in the number three (3) lane of traffic with his or her back to Deputy Watt. Deputy
Watt said he saw a subject on the ground (Decedent Chinedu Okobi) in a lane of traffic who had
already been tased and had Taser wires extending from his person to a Taser in the hand of Deputy
Wang. Deputy Watt said the one (1) of the Taser probes appeared to be in the back of what he
though was Decedent Okobi’s left hand. Deputy Watt described Decedent Okobi as “a big person”
and estimated Okobi to be between 6’ to 6’3” tall and weighing “at least three hundred pounds”.
Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi was on his back and he saw both Deputy Lorenzatti and
Sergeant Weidner attempting to convince Okobi to roll over on his stomach. Deputy Watt saw
“somebody” try to grab one of Decedent Okobi’s hands but Okobi pulled his hand away.

Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi was not physically resisting but was also not complying with
the commands he was being given. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi was “becoming more and
more agitated” and was “rolling around”. Deputy Watt said he tried to verbally engage Decedent
Okobi by telling him to roll on to his stomach and warning Okobi he would be “tased again” if he
did not comply. Deputy Watt could only recall hearing Decedent Okobi say something like “get
them off me” or get them out of me” which Deputy Watt believed was a reference to the Taser
probes in Okobi’s body. Deputy Watt said he tried to reach out and grab one of Decedent Okobi’s
hands but Okobi kept pulling his hand away. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi was able to get
back up on his feet and Deputy Wang activated his Taser a second time, causing Okobi to go to
the ground again. Deputy Watt said the second activation of the Taser on Decedent Okobi was
effective for only “a second or two” before Okobi was “able to fight through that”. Deputy Watt
said Decedent Okobi was able to get back on to his feet and Deputy Watt said he drew and extended
his ASP (collapsible baton) but did not ever strike Okobi with it. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi

a ns)
JAMIE DRAPER 29
then began to move south-east across the lanes of traffic on El Camino Real away from the
involved deputies.

Deputy Watt said once the group moved to the northbound lanes of traffic following Decedent
Okobi, Deputy Wang drew and extended his ASP. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi had his hands
around Deputy Wang’s waist area and Deputy Wang struck decedent Okobi at least once with the
ASP and appeared to break free from Decedent Okobi’s grasp. Deputy Watt said he saw Decedent
Okobi throwing punches “in about the face” of Deputy Wang once Deputy Wang broke free of
Okobi’s grasp but could not be certain the punches connected. Deputy Watt said Deputy John
DeMartini was able to tackle Decedent Okobi and take Okobi to the ground. Deputy Watt said
once Decedent Okobi was on the ground, he and the other involved deputies converged on Okobi
and tried to gain physical control of Okobi. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi was “flailing
around” and was able to turn over to the point where he was nearly on his back again during the
struggle. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi had gotten up on his side when someone (unknown to
him who) deployed pepper spray which struck Deputy Watt in the face and eyes.

Deputy Watt said he was blinded by the pepper spray deployment and removed himself from the
struggle to get Decedent Okobi into handcuffs. Deputy Watt did recall giving his handcuffs to one
of the other involved deputies and recalled Decedent Okobi being handcuffed with two (2) sets of
linked handcuffs. Deputy Watt said Decedent Okobi was then turned on his side and was moved
up to a seated position with Deputy Watt using his legs to support Okobi upright. Deputy Watt
stated Decedent Okobi had his head facing down toward his chest when he was resting against
Deputy Watt’s legs. Deputy Watt said he was unsure if Decedent Okobi was breathing because he
was not moving around to the extent Deputy Watt expected after the struggle. Deputy Watt said
he tried to check Decedent Okobi for a pulse at the neck and Okobi immediately brought his head
up and was looking around. Deputy Watt said he could see Decedent Okobi was breathing so he
did not continue to check for a pulse. Deputy Watt said he was speaking to Decedent Okobi, telling
him to relax and breath but he did not recall Okobi ever saying anything in response. Deputy Watt
said he was relieved from his position supporting Decedent Okobi upright, so he could flush his
eyes with water but did see paramedics arrive on scene and begin treating Okobi. Deputy Watt
said he looked back a short time later and saw paramedics were performing CPR.

Deputy Watt stated he initially believed Decedent Okobi was possibly needed to be evaluated for
a mental health hold but after observing Okobi’s strength and the way Okobi was fighting off
attempts to get him under control, Deputy Watt said he now believed Decedent Okobi was under
the influence of a controlled substance. Deputy Watt did not utilize any of the weapons available
to him during the incident and stated that other than the already discussed usage of the Taser and
ASP by Deputy Wang and the use of pepper spray by someone unknown to him, none of the other
involved deputies used any of their other weapon options on Decedent Okobi during the incident.
Deputy Watt was asked whether his CIT training would have been effective in gaining Decedent
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 30
Okobi’s compliance during the incident. Deputy Watt said due to the fact Decedent Okobi was
already actively engaged in a fight, had already been tased and was either “not listening, not
hearing or didn’t want to talk”, Deputy Watt did not believe any of the techniques he learned in
CIT training could have been utilized in that situation. Deputy Watt was also asked if this was a
situation where he felt he or the other involved deputies could have backed away and allowed
Decedent Okobi to walk away from them. Deputy Watt said he would not have been able to walk
away from Decedent Okobi because Okobi had already been tased when he arrived on scene and
San Mateo County Sheriff's Office policy required they stay and seek medical help for Okobi once
the Taser had been used. Deputy Watt also pointed out Decedent Okobi had already displayed a
willingness to fight with law enforcement which Deputy Watt believed made it unsafe for Okobi
to remain in the general public.

Statement of Deputy John DeMartini:

I conducted an interview with Deputy John DeMartini on October 5, 2018 at the San Mateo County
District Attorney’s Office. Present for this interview was Deputy DeMartini’s attorney Gregory
Thoming with Mastagni Holstedt, APC. At the request of Deputy DeMartini and Mastagni
Holstedt, APC, Deputy DeMartini viewed footage from his Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recorder
as well as video footage captured by witness Robert Garrison. The audio for Garrison’s video
footage was removed prior to Deputy DeMartini viewing the video.

Deputy DeMartini has been employed as a Deputy Sheriff with the San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office for approximately seventeen (17) years. Prior to being employed by the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office, Deputy DeMartini was employed as a Deputy Sheriff for the San Francisco
County Sheriff's Department for approximately four and a half (4.5) years. Deputy DeMartini was
not employed by any other police agency prior to joining the San Francisco County Sheriff's
Department. Prior to his law enforcement career, Deputy DeMartini served in the United States
Arny for approximately four (4) years and was not deployed to any conflict or combat situations.
During his career with the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, Deputy DeMartini has been
assigned primarily to the Corrections, Transportation and Patrol Bureaus. Deputy DeMartini was
also briefly assigned to the Civil Division when he worked for the San Francisco County Sheriff's
Department. Deputy DeMartini has attended Crisis Intervention Training (CIT).

On October 3, 2018 Deputy DeMartini was assigned to work patrol out of the Millbrae Patrol
Bureau working an overtime shift from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. On October 1, 2018 and October 2,
2018, Deputy DeMartini worked his normal assigned shift working the same 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM
shift out of the Millbrae Patrol Bureau. Deputy DeMartini was driving San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office vehicle #16, a fully marked Ford Taurus police vehicle equipped with functioning code-3
lighting equipment and a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system. Deputy DeMartini was
wearing a full, short-sleeved police uniform with Sheriff's Office patches affixed to both shoulders

a ns)
JAMIE DRAPER 31
with a metal badge and metal name tag affixed to the chest area. Deputy DeMartini did not utilize
an external ballistic vest carrier at the time of this incident.

Deputy DeMartini said he was at the Millbrae Police Substation report writing area after finishing
his lunch break. Deputy DeMartini said he heard a broadcast coming from Deputy Bryan Watt’s
radio. Deputy DeMartini said the volume knob on his radio had inadvertently been turned down
when he sat in a chair, but Deputy Watt was near him, so he could hear his radio. Deputy DeMartini
said he did not hear the content of the broadcast and Deputy Watt told him Deputy Wang was
asking for an additional unit. Deputy DeMartini said Deputy Lorenzatti got up and left the report
writing area to cover Deputy Wang. Deputy DeMartini said he turned his radio volume knob back
up and heard Deputy Wang asking for “code three cover” as he and Deputy Watt were walking
out to their own patrol vehicles.

Deputy DeMartini recalled Deputy Wang putting out a description of the subject of his stop as a
“black male with bags”. Deputy DeMartini said he responded to the area with his overhead lighting
equipment and siren activated. Deputy DeMartini said he arrived in the area and saw a subject
(Decedent Chinedu Okobi) walking south on El Camino Real. Deputy DeMartini said he could see
Deputy Wang further north on El Camino Real and heard Deputy Wang broadcast that Decedent
Okobi was walking southbound toward incoming units. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi
was the only subject he saw in the area. Deputy DeMartini said he and Deputy Lorenzatti both
exited their patrol vehicles and tried to contact the subject, saying something like “can we talk to
you” and “let me see your hands”. Deputy DeMartini said Deputy Lorenzatti attempted to grab
Decedent Okobi but could not see where on Okobi Deputy Lorenzatti tried to grab as Okobi was
between he and Deputy Lorenzatti. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi pulled away from
Deputy Lorenzatti and noted Okobi had already discarded the bags he had been carrying when he
first saw him. Deputy DeMartini said based upon his own experience, the act of discarding items
was “somebody getting ready to use their hands. They don’t want to be encumbered” which led
Deputy DeMartini to believe Decedent Okobi was getting prepared to fight with them.

Deputy DeMartini said he attempted to grab Decedent Okobi by one of his wrists to place Okobi
in a control hold, but Okobi pulled away from him and left Deputy DeMartini with a “handful of
his sweater”. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was able to pull completely out of the
sweater and break free from his attempts to detain him. Deputy DeMartini said he made a second
attempt to grab Decedent Okobi, but Okobi pulled away again and Deputy Wang deployed his
Taser, striking Decedent Okobi and causing Okobi to fall to the ground in the roadway. Deputy
DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was lying supine on the ground so he and the other involved
deputies began giving Okobi commands to roll over on to his stomach to handcuff him. Deputy
DeMartini said he could see the Taser probes embedded in the right chest area and in the back of
one of the hands of Decedent Okobi. Deputy DeMartini was uncertain which hand the second
probe was in, but believed it was possibly in Okobi’s left hand. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 32
Okobi was not paying attention to their commands to roll over and was attempting to pull the Taser
“leads” out of his body while kicking his legs out at Deputy DeMartini and the other involved
deputies. Deputy DeMartini said he attempted to grasp Decedent Okobi’s ankles to try and prevent
Okobi from kicking them but was unable hold on to him. Deputy DeMartini described the Taser
as being effective in that it took Decedent Okobi to the ground but also said it was ineffective in
that it did not gain compliance from Okobi. Deputy DeMartini described Decedent Okobi as
having “shrugged it off’ regarding the effects of the Taser. Deputy DeMartini noted in his past
experience, a normal person not under the influence or having mental health issues generally will
comply after a Taser deployment.

Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was able to get back on his feet and began to run east
across El Camino Real when Deputy Wang activated his Taser a second time, which caused Okobi
to fall to the ground again. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was able to get back up on his
feet again after the second activation of the Taser. Deputy DeMartini recalled having seen Deputy
Watt with his ASP (collapsible baton) out and fully extended; however, did not believe Deputy
Watt ever struck Decedent Okobi with the ASP. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi began to
run east across the lanes of traffic for El Camino Real. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi
was in between he and Deputy Wang but he could see Deputy Wang bring his ASP but did not see
if Deputy Wang made any attempt to strike Okobi. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was
flailing his hands as he advanced toward Deputy Wang. Deputy DeMartini said he was concerned
“because of the sheer size of the guy”. Decedent Okobi would be able to grab the ASP and take it
from Deputy Wang. Deputy DeMartini said he felt he needed to knock Decedent Okobi to the
ground before he could attempt to grab the ASP, so he did a “shoulder check” style tackle on Okobi
which caused he, Okobi and Deputy Wang to all fall to the ground together.

Deputy DeMartini said once they were on the ground, he attempted to control Decedent Okobi’s
legs, but Okobi kept kicking. Deputy DeMartini described the other involved deputies as
attempting to grab Decedent Okobi’s arms to get them behind Okobi’s back so he could be placed
in handcuffs. Deputy DeMartini said while they were on the ground struggling to control Decedent
Okobi, someone (unknown to him who) deployed pepper spray which struck and blinded some of
the other deputies. Deputy DeMartini said they were able get one of Decedent Okobi’s arms behind
him and he was able to place a handcuff on one of Okobi’s arms. Due to the size of Decedent
Okobi, Deputy DeMartini said they had to utilize a second set of handcuffs linked together before
he was able to get Okobi’s other arm handcuffed. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was
“being vocal” when they were struggling to place him in handcuffs but could not recall what Okobi

was saying.

Deputy DeMartini said once Decedent Okobi was handcuffed, they rolled Okobi onto his side and
ultimately brought him up into a seated position with his back resting against Deputy Watt’s legs.
Deputy DeMartini said he later relieved Deputy Watt’s position so Deputy Watt could flush his
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 33
eyes with water due to the pepper spray exposure. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi was
not alert, but he could hear Okobi breathing while he supported him upright. Deputy DeMartini
said Decedent Okobi’s head was facing downward so he lifted Okobi’s head back to aid his
breathing and checked him for a pulse at his carotid artery. Deputy DeMartini said he felt a pulse
but said due to the fact he had just been struggling with Okobi, he was no longer certain if he felt
Okobi’s pulse or his own pulse. Deputy DeMartini said he was relieved by another unknown
deputy and was directed by Sergeant Weidner to go take photographs of the scene and obtain
statements from witnesses. Deputy DeMartini said he was away from Decedent Okobi’s location
for quite a while and when he returned, he saw Okobi being loaded into an ambulance.

I asked Deputy DeMartini to describe Decedent Okobi’s physical appearance to me. Deputy
DeMartini described Decedent Okobi as “a large guy” who was approximately 6’3” to 6’4” and
weighing more than three hundred (300) pounds. Deputy DeMartini said when he first observed
Decedent Okobi, Okobi’s eyes were “wide open” and “his pupils were pretty pinned out”. I asked
Deputy DeMartini if he believed Decedent Okobi was possibly suffering from mental illness or
was under the influence of a controlled substance. Deputy DeMartini stated “one or the other or
both”. Deputy DeMartini also described Decedent Okobi as a “very strong guy”. Deputy
DeMartini said he did not see Decedent Okobi strike Deputy Wang but did see physical injuries
on Deputy Wang’s face after Okobi was detained. Deputy DeMartini said he suffered abrasions to
both hands, both knees, and his right elbow during the struggle to handcuff Decedent Okobi.

I asked Deputy DeMartini if he felt he could have utilized his CIT training to de-escalate the
incident. Deputy DeMartini said he did not believed the techniques he learned from CIT training
would have been effective because Decedent Okobi was “agitated to the point where it wouldn’t
have sunk in. I don’t think he would have listened”. Deputy DeMartini told me he does not have
any formal training in recognizing persons under the influence of a control substance but is
generally aware of the signs and symptoms of controlled substance influence based upon his
twenty-one (21) years in law enforcement and the many contacts he has had working in the jail
and on patrol. I asked Deputy DeMartini if he felt he or the other involved deputies could have
backed away from the situation and let Decedent Okobi walk away. Deputy DeMartini said he did
not believe they could have let Decedent Okobi go due to his demeanor and the fact he was an on-
going danger to himself and others by walking in and out of busy, mid-day traffic on El Camino
Real. Deputy DeMartini added his belief Decedent Okobi was a danger to himself and needed to
be evaluated for a mental health hold. Deputy DeMartini said Decedent Okobi’s size, strength and
the fact they had such difficulty in getting him detained and handcuffed indicated Okobi could
have possibly caused injury to the deputies and members of the public had Okobi been allowed to
get away from them.

REVIEW OF MOBILE AUDIO VIDEO (MAV):

Inspector Kevin Raffaelli reviewed and summarized the video footage captured by the Mobile
Audio Video (MAV) systems from the patrol vehicles of each of the five (5) deputies involved in
the attempts to take Decedent Chinedu Okobi into custody on October 3, 2018.

MAYV for San Mateo County Sheriffs Office Vehicle #10 (Deputy Joshua Wang)

13:00:00 Deputy Wang approached the intersection of Capuchino Drive driving south on El
Camino Real. Decedent Okob1 is visible as he walked from the northwest corner of
Millwood Drive, east across El Camino Real. The pedestrian crosswalk for
Millwood Drive is located on the south side of the intersection and not where
Decedent Okobi entered El Camino Real. The traffic signal for southbound El
Camino Real at Millwood Drive was visible as Decedent Okobi crossed and
showed it was green. Decedent Okobi caused a vehicle travelling southbound to
slow but it continued through the intersection past Okobi. Decedent Okobi
continued eastbound and walked into lane #2 as the traffic light for southbound El
Camino changed to yellow and then red as Okobi approached the center median.

13:00:25 Deputy Wang did a U-turn as Decedent Okobi walked northeast at an angle across
the northbound traffic lanes of El Camino Real.

13:00:31 Deputy Wang pulled alongside of Decedent Okobi near San Juan Avenue and El
Camino Real. Deputy Wang is heard stating “Hey, hold up a minute” and “Hold up
a minute”. Decedent Okobi is not in view of the MAV camera.

13:00:59: Deputy Wang’s MAV showed Decedent Okobi as he walked northbound in the
center median. Deputy Wang contacted County Communications utilizing his call
sign of “Boy-62”.

13:01:09 Decedent Okobi is shown having reached the western sidewalk as southbound
traffic approaches the area.

13:01:10 Deputy Wang advised County Communications “Can you put me on a ped stop at
ECR and Capuchino and can you roll me one more unit please”.

13:01:26 Deputy Wang advised County Communications “and if you could send them Code
3, he’s running on ECR into traffic”. Decedent Okobi is seen moving south in the
left turn lane for northbound traffic. Decedent Okobi was seen looking toward
Deputy Wang’s vehicle before he turned and walked toward the east sidewalk.

13:01:47 Decedent Okobi is shown running northbound at El Camino Real and Capuchino
where he crossed southbound lanes of traffic. Several vehicles southbound on El
Camino Real stopped to avoid striking Okobi.

13:01:55 Deputy Wang advised County Communications “he’s on foot, I am just paralleling
him on ECR, he’s a BMA about 6 feet tall, 220 pounds wearing a blue and black
stripe shirt, still walking in traffic”.

JAMIE DRAPER 36
13:02:50 Deputy Wang exited his vehicle, a muffled voice possibly belonging to Decedent
Okobi stated “what”, and Deputy Wang said, “let’s come over here and talk on the
sidewalk”.

13:03:00 Deputy Wang got back into his car and accelerated north on El Camino Real,
Deputy Wang advised County Communications “still walking northbound ECR”

13:03:45 Two additional Sheriff’s Department vehicles are shown as they cross from the
northbound lanes into the southbound lanes of El Camino Real toward Decedent
Okobi.

13:03:49 Decedent Okobi continued to walk south and raised his hands.

13:03:51 Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti approached Decedent Okobi from the south, pointed
toward Decedent Okobi and stated, “Get down on the ground”. Decedent Okobi
continued to walk southbound past Deputy Lorenzatti as Deputy Lorenzatti reached
to grab Decedent Okobi’s left hand. Decedent Okobi moved his hand to avoid her
grab attempt.

13:03:57 Deputy Wang and Deputy DeMartini ran to assist Deputy Lorenzatti as Decedent
Okobi raised his hands and continued to walk away.

13:04:02 Deputy Lorenzatti grabbed Decedent Okobi’s arm and said, “Stop resisting”.
Deputy Wang said, “You are going to get Tased, get on the ground, now!” A
struggle then ensued between the deputies and Decedent Okobi. Decedent Okobi
can be seen resisting and trying to pull away from the deputies. Decedent Okobi
pulled away from Deputy DeMartini who was holding Okobi’s shirt sleeve until
Okobi was able to slip out of the shirt and away from Deputy DeMartini’s grasp.

13:04:13 Decedent Okobi tured to run south on El Camino Real when Deputy Wang
deployed his Taser at Okobi. Decedent Okobi fell forward on the ground.

13:04:17 Decedent Okobi rolled on his back with his legs and arms extended. Deputy Wang
advised County Communications “Give me a Code 33, we have a Taser
deployment”. The deputies can be heard telling Decedent Okobi to “roll over on
your stomach, now”.

13:04:30 Deputy Wang broadcast on the radio “second Taser deployment” as Decedent
Okobi remained on his back and continued to not comply with commands.

13:04:40 Deputy Wang said, “I am going to Tase you again if you do not roll over on your
stomach”. Continual commands are heard being given but Decedent Okobi did not
comply.

13:04:47. Deputy Wang advised over the radio “Still resisting, third Taser deployed”.
Decedent Okobi was given continual commands to roll over without compliance
and is seen pulling away from attempts being made to grab Okobi’s arms.

13:05:17 Decedent Okobi was able to get up and turn away from the deputies. Decedent
Okobi was possibly Tased again as he is seen falling to the ground. Deputy Watt
extended his ASP (collapsible baton) but did not strike Decedent Okobi.

JAMIE DRAPER 37
13:05:31 Decedent Okobi attempted to get up and then fell to the ground (unknown if the
Taser activated). Deputy Wang broadcast over the radio, “Boy 62, can you roll
medical”.

13:05:35 Decedent Okobi stood up and jogged away from the deputies headed east across El
Camino Real. All the deputies and Decedent Okobi left the view of the MAV
camera. The Taser can be heard being activated but the louder sound of the Taser
activation indicated it was no longer properly connected to Decedent Okobi.
Sergeant Weidner is heard telling Deputy Wang to “Turn the Taser off”.

Once the deputies and Decedent Okobi moved out of the view of the MAV camera and further
from Deputy Wang’s patrol vehicle, the audio became intermitted and difficult to hear.

MAYV for San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Vehicle #8 (Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti)

13:03:38 Deputy Lorenzatti arrived on scene as Decedent Okobi was walking on the west
sidewalk of El Camino Real. There is no audio outside of the vehicle for Deputy
Lorenzatti’s MAV system.

13:03:55 Decedent Okobi continued to walk toward Deputy Lorenzatti and raised his hands
upward, then put them to his side. Deputy Lorenzatti attempted to grab Decedent
Okobi’s left arm but Decedent Okobi pulled away from her.

13:03:58 Deputy DeMartini and Deputy Wang ran to assist Deputy Lorenzatti. The deputies
attempted to grab Decedent Okobi, but Okobi broke free. Deputy DeMartini held
onto Decedent Okobi’s left shirt sleeve, but Okobi was able to shed the shirt and
got away from Deputy DeMartini’s grasp.

13:04:09 Decedent Okobi began to run away but turned and ran at Deputy Wang while
reaching out with his right hand and slapped at the Deputy Wang’s Taser. Deputy
Wang deployed his Taser at Decedent Okobi, who took a few steps away from
Deputy Wang before he fell to the ground.

13:04:21 All parties moved out of the view of the MAV camera.

MAYV for San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Vehicle # 1 (Sergeant David Weidner)

13:04:10 Sergeant Weidner exited his vehicle and ran to assist the deputies as they attempted
to detain Decedent Okobi and Okobi pulled away from them. Decedent Okobi
began to run away then turned and moved toward Deputy Wang. Deputy Wang had
his Taser out and pointed it at Decedent Okobi as Okobi ran toward Deputy Wang.
Deputy Wang deployed his Taser at Decedent Okobi as Okobi raised his hand and
appeared to reach toward Deputy Wang. Decedent Okobi took a few steps towards
Deputy Wang then turned and fell to the ground. Deputy Lorenzatti moved in to
grab Decedent Okobi’s right hand. Deputy Lorenzatti was unable to grab Decedent

_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 38
Okobi’s right hand and moved to grab Decedent Okobi’s left hand while Sergeant
Weidner and Deputy DeMartini tried to control Decedent Okobi legs. Decedent
Okobi was able to break free of Deputy Lorenzatti’s hold and kicked his legs at
Sergeant Weidner and Deputy DeMartini.

13:04:25 Deputy Wang ordered Decedent Okobi to roll over and warned him of another
Taser activation. Deputy Wang activated the Taser a second time when Decedent
Okobi refused to comply.

13:04:33 Decedent Okobi continued to not comply with multiple requests to roll over onto
his stomach and kicked out at the deputies with his feet. Deputy Wang activated his
Taser for a third time.

13:05:48 Sergeant Weidner grabbed Decedent Okobi's left arm and made several attempts to
gain Okobi’s compliance by telling Okobi they would remove the Taser probes if
Okobi rolled over. Decedent Okobi can be heard stating “spread the word of God”
and Sergeant Weidner responded by saying “Okay, okay, okay. We’ll do that. Roll
over on your stomach”.

13:05:16 Decedent Okobi got to a standing position and Deputy Wang appeared to activate
his Taser a fourth time. Decedent Okobi turned away from Deputy Wang and took
two (2) steps before he fell to the ground. Decedent Okobi yelled “somebody help
me” as the deputies continued to order Okobi to roll onto his stomach. Deputy Watt
is shown expanding his ASP (collapsible baton) and holding it as if prepared to
strike; however, Deputy Watt is not ever seen using the ASP to strike Decedent
Okobi.

13:05:24 Decedent Okobi attempted get to his feet but fell to a seated position, then onto his
back before sitting up quickly. Decedent Okobi again yelled “somebody help me”
and got back to his feet. Decedent Okobi then left the view of the MAV camera
with the deputies following him. Deputy Wang can be seen expanding his ASP
(collapsible baton).

13:04:48 Once Decedent Okobi and the deputies are out of view of the MAV camera, the
audio from Sergeant Weidner’s body-worn microphone can still be heard. Two (2)
more Taser activations are heard but are much louder indicating the Taser is no
longer connected to at least one (1) probe rendering it ineffective. Sergeant Weidner
can be heard telling Deputy Wang to turn the Taser off during the last activation.

13:06:18 Sergeant Weidner told the deputies “stay on top of him, stay on top of him, watch
out he’s bleeding”. Sergeant Weidner continuously told Decedent Okobi to give
him his hands. Multiple deputies can be heard yelling in pain and one asked “who
did that?” Deputy Watt can be heard stating “I’m out” and Deputy Lorenzatti can
be heard saying “I can’t see”. Sergeant Weidner instructed Deputy Lorenzatti to
“stay in this, stay in it”.

JAMIE DRAPER 39
13:07:52 Sergeant Weidner told the deputies to “watch for positional asphyxia”. Sergeant
Weidner also made several radio broadcasts which will be summarized in a separate
area of this report.

13:08:50 Sergeant Weidner told the deputies “watch his breathing”. One of deputies is heard
asking “you alright” and stating, “he’s still breathing”.

13:09:25 Sergeant Weidner is heard stating “sit him up”.

13:10:00: Sergeant Weidner is heard stating “take his pulse”.

13:11:38 Sergeant Weidner states, “is he okay, is he okay?” and “check his pulse”.

13:13:48 Sergeant Weidner is heard stating “I need you to check his pulse to make sure he is
good to go”.

13:17:25 One of the medical personnel can be heard stating “we need to go”, Sergeant
Weidner is heard telling someone “we need to follow him”.

REVIEW OF CIVILIAN VIDEO FOOTAGE:

Witness Robert Garrison took a total of six (6) short video clips from inside the Tri Counties Bank
(1551 El Camino Real, Millbrae CA) which depicted various portions of the attempts by San Mateo
County Sheriff's Deputies to detain Decedent Okobi. The video clips begin after the first
deployment of the Taser by Deputy Joshua Wang. The audio portion of these videos only captures
commentary by Garrison and other persons inside the bank and not the activity outside involving
Decedent Okobi. Inspector Kevin Raffaelli reviewed and summarized the videos by Garrison in a
supplemental report. The following is a summary of Inspector Raffaelli’s observations from
Garrison’s video clips.

Video #1 (File Name: IMG _3665):
Decedent Okobi is shown on the ground, laying on his back in the roadway. Deputy Wang’s right

arm is seen holding a Taser which has already been deployed. Sergeant Weidner, Deputy
Lorenzatti, Deputy DeMartini and Deputy Watt are shown attempting to grab Decedent Okobi’s
arms and legs. Decedent Okobi is seen resisting the attempts to grab his limbs by swinging his
arms and kicking with his legs. (Total video length: 34 seconds).

Video #2 (File Name: IMG_3666):

Decedent Okobi is shown on his back and resisting attempts by the deputies to control his limbs.
Decedent Okobi is seen getting back up onto his feet and taking several steps before an apparent
Taser activation caused him to fall to the ground. The view of Decedent Okobi on the ground is
obstructed by a patrol vehicle between Okobi and the camera. Deputy Watt can be seen taking out
and expanding his ASP (collapsible baton) but does not strike Decedent Okobi. The camera is seen
being moved to a different window within the bank. Once the camera is back on the activity outside
the bank, Decedent Okobi is shown standing and then jogging east across El Camino Real. The
camera is moved again to a different window within the bank. Once in the new location, the camera
captured footage of Decedent Okobi having turned to face the pursuing deputies and back peddling
away from them. Deputy Wang can be seen holding an ASP (collapsible baton) and appeared to
attempt a strike to the midsection of Decedent Okobi. Decedent Okobi is seen throwing a punch
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 41
with his right hand which connected to the left side of Deputy Wang’s face. The group of deputies
and Decedent Okobi moved further south and out of the primary view of Witness Garrison’s
camera. Once Witness Garrison is able to pan the camera further south, Decedent Okobi can be
seen on the ground and the involved deputies are seen attempting to hold Okobi down on the
ground. (Total video length: 74 seconds).

Video #3 (File Name: IMG_3667):

Decedent Okobi is shown on the ground in the northbound lanes of El Camino Real. The involved
deputies are shown continuing to struggle with Decedent Okobi. Vehicular traffic from the El
Camino can be seen driving past and limited the view of the activity in this clip. (Total video
length: 26 seconds).

Video #4 (File Name: IMG _3668):
Decedent Okobi remained on the ground with the involved deputies attempting to handcuff Okobi.

By the end of this segment, the deputies appear to have gotten Decedent Okobi handcuffed. (Total
video length: 49 seconds).

Video #5 (File Name: IMG_3669):
Decedent Okobi is shown being moved to a seated position. Sergeant Weidner is seen bending
down and checking Okobi’s face several times during the clip. (Total video length: 52 seconds).

Video #6 (File Name: IMG_3670):
Decedent Okobi is shown in a seated position and paramedics have arrived on the scene and are
shown tending to Okobi. (Total video length: 9 seconds).

Timeline of Events:
Inspector Kevin Raffaelli completed an estimated incident timeline showing the elapsed time of
the significant events which occurred during the incident in October 3, 2018. Inspector Raffaelli
compiled this timeline via his review of the available video footage and dispatch radio traffic.
Inspector Raffaelli determined the first Taser activation occurred approximately 4 minutes and 12
seconds (4:12) after Decedent Chinedu Okobi can first be seen crossing El Camino Real against a
red traffic signal. The third and final fully effective five (5) second activation of the Taser occurred
twenty-eight (28) seconds after the first activation. The fourth activation which was likely
ineffective then occurred thirty-seven (37) seconds after Taser activation number three (3). Deputy
Wang made the first request for paramedics to respond to the scene fourteen (14) seconds after
activation number four (4). Decedent Okobi ran across El Camino Real approximately 5 minutes
and 34 seconds (5:34) after the original jaywalking incident and is brought to the ground by the
deputies twenty-five (25) seconds later. Decedent Okobi appeared to have ultimately been placed
in handcuffs between 1 minute and 31 seconds (1:31) and 1 minute and 53 seconds (1:53) after
being taken to the ground. Sergeant David Weidner makes a request for paramedics to respond
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 42
approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds (2:45) after Taser activation number four (4). Decedent
Okobi is placed in a seated position somewhere between 1 minutes and 37 seconds (1:37) and 1
minute and 55 seconds (1:55) after being successfully handcuffed. The first group of
paramedics/fire fighters arrived on scene 7 minutes and 12 seconds (7:12) after Taser activation
number (4) and the first ambulance arrived on scene twenty-nine (29) seconds later. Paramedics
initiated CPR on Decedent Okobi 3 minutes and 57 seconds (3:57) after the arrival of the first
ambulance and 12 minutes and 39 seconds after Taser activation number four (4). If Taser
activation number three (3) was the final effective activation, Decedent Okobi appeared to go into
cardiac arrest approximately 13 minutes and 16 seconds (13:16) later.

For further details regarding the timeline of events, Inspector Raffaelli’s timeline is attached to
this report as “Appendix A”

STATEMENTS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS OF DECEDENT CHINEDU OKOBI:

tatement of Telema Okobi (Father of Decedent Chinedu Okobi):

On November 7, 2018, Senior Inspector Rich Maher spoke via telephone with Telema Okobi.
Telema Okobi had previously contacted District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe and identified himself
as the father of Decedent Chinedu Okobi and stated he wished to discuss the investigation as well
as talk about his son. Telema Okobi told Senior Inspector Maher he had called the District
Attorney’s Office to “share his heart” and expressed frustration with efforts being made to
“politicize the death” of his son. Telema Okobi stated he loved Decedent Okobi and had a
“wonderful” relationship with him.

Telema Okobi told Senior Inspector Maher he had spoken with Decedent Okobi two (2) days
before his death. Telema Okobi stated Decedent Okobi was in Texas at the time of the call and
was discussing returning to the Bay Area to “get into the corporate world”. Telema Okobi said he
did not know Decedent Okobi was back in the Bay Area until he got a phone call from Decedent
Okobi’s mother informing him of Decedent Okobi’s death. Telema Okobi acknowledged that
Decedent Okobi had mental health issues for which he took medication; however, he did not know
the names of the medications. Telema Okobi stated Decedent Okobi rejected the fact he was
incapable of caring for himself and Telema Okobi felt the administration of Decedent Okobi’s
medications should have been supervised by his mother or someone else. Telema Okobi said
Decedent Okobi would at times cease taking his medications and Decedent Okobi’s sister would
call Telema Okobi to have him contact his son and encourage him to take his medications.

Telema Okobi told Senior Inspector Maher “we have a responsibility as parents. Ahh, I felt that,
ahh, when they expect the law enforcement to read the mind of somebody you don’t know; you
see a 6 foot 3 guy with 300 pounds, who is my son. I mean, going in and out of traffic, I mean you
don’t read the mind you just do everything, you don’t want anybody to become a public charge. If
the mother and I know that he has any mental problems, we should I mean, we should make sure
he is in a place, ahh place, safe place, he is a brilliant son.” Senior Inspector Maher asked Telema
Okobi if Decedent Okobi had any diagnosed physical health problems and Telema Okobi said he
did not and added, “He is ... all American; huge, I mean handsome, strong. I mean if I was a
policeman; I’ll tell you. If that mass of humanity comes towards me. It was a nightmare, I mean
as a nightmare, I mean he’s well built.”

Telema Okobi said he though Decedent Okobi had previous contact with law enforcement and
said Decedent Okobi was once “in custody” in Redwood City for “mental problems.” Telema
Okobi did not share any details but suggested the information was available.

Statement of Ebele Okobi (Sister of Decedent Chinedu Okobi):

On November 16, 2018, Inspector James Haggarty spoke with Decedent Okobi’s sister, Ebele
Okobi at the District Attorney’s Office. Ebele Okobi was present with other members of the Okobi
family and the family’s retained attorney, John Burris and Ebele Okobi acted as the primary
spokesperson for the family during Inspector Haggarty’s questions regarding Decedent Okobi’s
background. Ebele Okobi said Decedent Okobi’s first known display of mental illness by Decedent
Okobi occurred while attending Morehouse University and resulted in Okobi being hospitalized
in Atlanta. Ebele Okobi said her brother struggled to have his mental illness properly diagnosed
for many years, but once he was properly medicated, Decedent Okobi stopped “hearing voices” in

JAMIE DRAPER 46
his head. Ebele Okobi said Decedent Okobi failed to attend their family holiday gathering in
December of 2017 which led her to suspect her brother was no longer taking his medications.
Ebele Okobi said she had infrequent communications with Decedent Okobi after December of
2017. Ebele Okobi described Decedent Okobi as being fearful of law enforcement and afraid of
getting into trouble. Ebele Okobi said her brother’s fears of law enforcement were a natural
consequence of his being a large statured African-American male living in the United States.

TASER (AXON) REPORT:
On October 17, 2018 Senior Inspector Bill Massey met with Sergeant Bob Pronske of the San

Mateo County Sheriff’s Office for the purposes of downloading the event logs for the five (5)
Tasers assigned to Deputy Joshua Wang, Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti, Deputy Bryan Watt, Deputy
John DeMartini, and Sergeant David Weidner. Sergeant Pronske is the Lead Firearm and Taser
Instructor for the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office. Sergeant Pronske connected all five (5)
Tasers to the Axon Software in Senior Inspector Massey’s presence and downloaded the event

JAMIE DRAPER
logs for each device. Sergeant Pronske provided Senior Inspector Massey with PDF copies of each
Taser download report.

Senior Inspector Massey reviewed the contents of each download report for the five (5) Tasers
assigned to the involved deputies and noted only the event logs for Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P
showed the device had been deployed and utilized during the incident on October 3, 2018. The
event logs for showed a total of seven (7) activations consistent with having occurred during the
events surrounding the attempts to detain Decedent Chinedu Okobi. Utilizing the event logs for
Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P, Senior Inspector Massey was able to summarize the Taser usage and
gaps in activations as follows:

13:08:18 Deployed for 5 seconds, ending at: 13:08:23
Pause in activity for 9 seconds

13:08:32 Deployed for 5 seconds, ending at: 13:08:37
Pause in activity for 9 seconds

13:08:46 Deployed for 5 seconds, ending at: 13:08:51
Pause in activity for 28 seconds

13:09:19 Deployed for 5 seconds, ending at: 13:09:24
Pause in activity for 7 seconds

13:09:31 Deployed for 5 seconds, ending at: 13:09:36
Pause in activity for 5 seconds

13:09:41 Deployed for 5 seconds, ending at: 13:09:46
Pause in activity for 6 seconds

13:09:52 Deployed for 4 seconds, ending at: 13:09:56

The event logs showed Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P was placed in “Safe” mode at 13:09:56 which

resulted in the ending of the standard five (5) second cycle earlier by one (1) second for a cycle
time of four (4) seconds for the seventh and final activation.

Inspector Rick Decker conducted research on the Taser X26P and learned additional information
could be gleamed specifically from the X26P model of device. Inspector Decker learned the X26P
had the ability to allow a download of the “Pulse Logs” for each activation which would determine
whether the device was making a complete circuit for each activation. A completed circuit utilizing

a ns)
JAMIE DRAPER 53
the Taser in the probe deployment mode of utilization is achievable only when both Taser probes
are attached to a subject and the intact probe wires are connected between the probes and the Taser.

Inspector Decker obtained the necessary download software from Axon and was able to re-
download Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P and obtained the “pulse logs” for each of the seven (7)
recorded activations of the device. A review of these “pulse logs” showed only activations number
one (1) through three (3) were complete five (5) second cycles. This indicated the delivery of
electricity sufficient to cause Neuromuscular Incapacitation (NMI) was delivered from Deputy
Wang’s Taser into the person of Decedent Okobi for five (5) seconds in each of the first three (3)
activations of the Taser. The “pulse logs” cannot determine if the effects of NMI were felt by
Decedent Okobi, only as to whether the device was functioning properly or not during each
activation cycle. The “pulse log” for activation number four (4) showed the device was not making
a complete circuit and would not have been delivering electricity to Decedent Okobi for the first
three (3) seconds of the five (5) second activation cycle. At just over three (3) seconds into the
cycle for activation number four (4), a completed circuit was obtained consistent with electricity
being delivered to Decedent Okobi for approximately one (1) second before becoming ineffective
again for the final one (1) second of the activation cycle. This indicated one (1) of the wires
extending from the Taser X26P to one of the probes in Decedent Okobi’s person had likely become
partially detached which enabled the current to pass through only for the one (1) second window
when the wire was able to make a completed circuit. The “pulse logs” for activations five (5)
through seven (7) showed no electricity would have been delivered from the Taser X26P to
Decedent Okobi at any point during the final three (3) activation cycles likely due to damaged or
detached probe wires, rendering those activation cycles ineffective.

MEDICAL RECORDS REVIEW DEPUTY JOSHUA WANG:

The treatment records from Mills-Peninsula Hospital for the treatment of Deputy Joshua Wang on
October 3, 2018 were obtained from Sutter Health with the consent of Deputy Wang. A review of
these records indicated Deputy Wang was treated for a seven (7) cm laceration to the left side of
his face, a lateral cervical strain and a right wrist sprain. The facial laceration was anesthetized,
irrigated and repaired with five (5) sutures. Deputy Wang was provided antibiotics for the
laceration and instructed to take Motrin for his neck pain. No other injuries or complaints of pain
were noted in the medical records.

TRAFFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR EL CAMINO REAL IN MILLBRAE:

During Inspector Rick Decker’s interview with Deputy Joshua Wang on October 4, 2018, Deputy
Wang stated his intent in contacting Decedent Chinedu Okobi on October 3, 2018 was to conduct
a traffic enforcement stop of Decedent Okobi based upon Deputy Wang having seen crossing El
Camino Real at Millwood when Okobi was not permitted to cross. A review of the MAV video
footage from Deputy Wang’s vehicle did show Decedent Okobi walking eastbound across El
Camino Real against a red traffic signal and outside of a designated crossing area north of the

_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 54
intersection with Millwood Drive. During my interview with Sergeant David Weidner on October
4, 2018, Sergeant Weidner identified the City of Millbrae as having a high rate of pedestrian related
traffic accidents and identified the El Camino Real corridor near Millwood Drive as a “high traffic”
area.

Ispoke with captain Paul Kunkel of the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office regarding traffic related
issues in the City of Millbrae. Captain Kunkel has been assigned as the Commander for the
Millbrae Patrol Bureau since September 2018 and told me he has made traffic enforcement and
pedestrian safety a point of emphasis with the deputies under his command. Captain Kunkel said
traffic related complaints and pedestrian safety on the El Camino Real corridor are the primary
area of complaint expressed by the residence of Millbrae. Captain Kunkel said the Millbrae Patrol
Bureau, the City of Millbrae and Caltrans have been working to improve pedestrian safety on El
Camino Real for the last several years through better engineering, better signage and focused
enforcement. Captain Kunkel noted there has been several traffic enforcement details conducted
including one which was featured on the KRON 4 segment titled “People Behaving Badly”.
Captain Kunkel also told me the city and Caltrans have installed High Intensity Activated
Crosswalks (HAWKs) pedestrian crossing beacons at many of the crosswalks on El Camino Real.

I conducted research via San Mateo County Sheriff's Office records and available media
information regarding pedestrian related accidents in the City of Millbrae since the San Mateo
County Sheriff's Office took over police services for the city in 2012. In my research, I noted
Millbrae’s current population is approximately 22,500 residents and El Camino Real stretches
approximately 1.5 miles through the city. In looking at only pedestrian related accidents having
occurred along this 1.5 mile stretch of El Camino Real through Millbrae since 2012, I noted a total
of forty-eight (48) pedestrian related traffic accidents reported via the San Mateo County Sheriff’s
Office. Of these forty-eight (48) accidents, the primary collision factor in eleven (11) of the
accidents was determined to be either jaywalking or pedestrian in the roadway related violations.
An additional twenty-eight (28) accidents listed a primary collision factor related to drivers failing
to yield to pedestrians in lawful crossing areas. In looking at the reported locations of the forty-
eight (48) pedestrian related accidents, I noted fourteen (14) appeared to have occurred within
approximately 2000 feet in either direction of the intersection of El Camino Real and Millwood
Drive where Decedent Okobi was first observed crossing the roadway against a red traffic signal.

lalso reviewed traffic citations issued in the City of Millbrae by members of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office for either jaywalking or pedestrian in the roadway related violations. I located
twenty (20) citations for those violations since 2012. I also reviewed citations issued by Deputy
Joshua Wang over the past three (3) months and found he had issued forty-seven (47) citations
between July 3, 2018 and October 3, 2018. Twenty-one (21) of the citations issued by Deputy
Wang were for violations with a listed location on the El Camino Real corridor through Millbrae.
There were no citations by Deputy Wang for either jaywalking or pedestrian in the roadway related
_——_z_— aa
JAMIE DRAPER 55
violations; however, there were two (2) for violating the right of way of pedestrians in crosswalks
which occurred on El Camino Real.

CRIME LABORATORY REPORT SUMMARY (LAB# M18-04432):
Members of the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office Forensic Laboratory responded to the area of

the 1400 block of El Camino Real in Millbrae on October 3, 2018 and processed the crime scene.
Pertinent evidence was measured, photographed, and collected and a 3-D scan was completed of
the area. The duty belt and agency issued firearm belonging to Deputy Joshua Wang were also
provided to the Forensic Laboratory to be examined for the presence of fingerprints and potential
DNA in an attempt to corroborate statements made by both Deputy Wang and Sergeant David
Weidner regarding Decedent Chinedu Okobi having grabbed Deputy Wang’s holstered firearm
and/or the outer portion of Deputy Wang’s holster. No latent fingerprints were located on the
surface of Deputy Wang’s firearm nor on any portions of his duty belt. The firearm and duty belt
surfaces were swabbed for contact DNA and Criminalist Tan Ho determined a low-level, partial
mixture of DNA from at least two (2) individuals were developed. Criminalist Ho determined the
low-level mixture of DNA was inconclusive for comparison purposes and thus it could not be
determined if Decedent Chinedu Okobi was one (1) of the contributors to the mixture of DNA
profiles developed.

CORONERS REPORT SUMMARY:

On December 31, 2018 I received the Coroner’s Office Report, prepared by Coroner’s Investigator
Heather Diaz. The report included redacted sections related to Decedent Chinedu Okobi’s medical
treatment on October 3, 2018 as well as redacted sections related to his previous medical and
mental health treatments pursuant to 56.10 of the California Civil Code. The “Conclusion Report”
by Coroner’s Investigator Diaz included a summary of the attempts by San Mateo County Sheriff’s
Office personnel to detain Decedent Okobi and noted Okobi was found to be “unresponsive” upon
the arrival of paramedics and fire personnel on the scene. It should be noted that this information
is contrary to what was seen upon review of the Mobile Audio Video (MAV) footage at the scene
and from the statements provided by fire department paramedics who stated they had determined
Decedent Okobi had a pulse and was breathing when they arrived on scene to begin treatment.

PATHOLOGY REPORT SUMMARY:

On December 31, 2018 I received the final Pathology Report, prepared by Forensic Pathologist
Thomas W. Rogers M.D. Doctor Rogers conducted an autopsy of Decedent Chinedu Okobi on
October 4, 2018 and listed Okobi’s cause of death as “Cardiac arrest following physical exertion,
physical restraint, and recent electro-muscular disruption”. Doctor Rogers further listed other
significant conditions contributing but not related to the immediate cause of death as
“Cardiomyopathy”.

a ns)
JAMIE DRAPER 56
Doctor Rogers noted that Decedent Okobi’s heart was enlarged and noted Okobi’s heart weighed
610 grams. The normal weight for a human, male heart is approximately 331 grams on average.
Doctor Rogers also noted the presence of “occasional hypertrophied cardiac muscle cell” and
“occasional areas of small scarring” present in Decedent Okobi’s heart.

Doctor Rogers noted several small abrasions at various locations on Decedent Okobi’s body,
primarily on Okobi’s arms and hands. Petechial hemorrhages were also noted in the conjunctival
surface of both orbital areas of the eyes. Doctor Rogers examined Decedent Okobi’s neck and
determined Okobi’s larynx and hyoid bone were intact and noted no abnormalities to the superior
horns of the thyroid cartilage. In examining Decedent Okobi’s brain, Doctor Rogers noted findings
consistent with cerebral swelling, but noted no subdural, subarachnoid hemorrhages or epidural
hemorrhages.

TOXICOLOGY REPORT SUMMARY:

On December 31, 2018 I received the final toxicology report for the Chinedu, Chinedu Okobi,
from Central Valley Toxicology, Inc., #CVT-18-13046. The report noted a complete drug screen
of blood taken from Decedent Chinedu Okobi was conducted. The report noted “No common
acidic, neutral or basic drugs detected” and “No Ethyl Alcohol detected”. These results indicate
Decedent Okobi was not under the influence of any controlled substances, alcohol or prescription
medication prior to his death.

DISPOSITION:

This investigation in its entirety should be forwarded to the San Mateo County District Attorney’s
Office Executive Management Team for review.

SUPPLEMENT 1 - Officer Involved Critical Incident 18-1003-02
Protocol Activation and Response

Investigation:

On October 3, 2018 I was advised of an activation of the Officer-Involved Critical Incident (OICI)
Protocol by Senior Inspector Richard Maher. I was advised the protocol activation was being initiated by
the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office for an incident which occurred in the City of Millbrae for a use of
force incident involving the deployment of a Taser. I was advised subject of the Taser deployment, now
identified as Decedent Chinedu Okobi had been pronounced dead at Mills-Peninsula Hospital.

I responded to the command post which had been established in the area of El Camino Real and
Millwood Drive, Millbrae. Upon arrival, I met with Senior Inspector Bill Massey as well as Inspectors
Eric Suzuki and Greg Giguiere. Senior Inspector Massey advised me I would be assigned as the primary
investigator for the case, Inspector Suzuki would be assigned as the secondary investigator and Inspector
Giguiere would be assigned to oversee the crime scene and evidence collection.

We met with San Mateo County Sheriff’s Sergeant Jacob Trickett who provided us a walkthrough of the
scene as well as a summary of the events which had occurred leading to the activation of the protocol.
During Sergeant Trickett’s briefing of events, I learned the incident began when Sheriff's Deputy Joshua
Wang attempted to contact Decedent Okobi for “jaywalking” across El Camino Real near Millwood
Drive. Deputy Wang requested an additional cover unit and advised over the radio that Okobi was
refusing to stop for Deputy Wang and was running in and out of traffic on El Camino Real. Sergeant
Trickett identified the additional Sheriff's Office personnel who responded to the scene to assist Deputy
Wang as being Sergeant Dave Weidner, Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti, Deputy Bryan Watt and Deputy John
DeMartini. Sergeant Trickett said it was his understanding Deputy Wang and the other involved deputies
attempted to detain Decedent Okobi; however, Okobi became resistive and combative with the deputies,
resulting in at least one (1) Taser deployment which apparently was unsuccessful. Sergeant Trickett told
us this occurred in the area near a cross walk along the west curb line of El Camino Real near the
intersection of Santa Helena. Sergeant Trickett told us it was his understanding this crosswalk was not
the same location Deputy Wang first saw Decedent Okobi “jaywalking”. Sergeant Trickett went on to
advise us the struggle to detain Okobi, and get him into handcuffs, continued back east across El
Camino Real and then south on E] Camino Real near Capuchino Drive.

Sergeant Trickett told us the involved deputies were eventually able to get Decedent Okobi to the ground
and get him handcuffed in the northbound lanes of El Camino Real. Sergeant Trickett told us Deputy
Wang had sustained a laceration to the face and a suspected concussion during the incident and was
transported to Mills-Peninsula. Sergeant Trickett stated at an unknown point shortly after being detained,
and being worked on at the scene by paramedics, Decedent Okobi appeared to have stopped breathing
and suffered a possible cardiac event which required him to also be transported to Mills-Peninsula
Hospital where he was later pronounced deceased by medical staff. Sergeant Trickett informed us the
remaining involved deputies had been taken to a nearby hotel pending the arrival of their legal
representation. Sergeant Trickett informed us each of the involved deputies and the involved sergeant
were driving marked Sheriff's Office vehicles which were equipped with Mobile Audio Video (MAV)

which should have captured the events. He advised us all of the vehicles were still on the scene except
for the vehicle driven by Deputy DeMartini, which was at the Millbrae Police Substation.

Senior Inspector Massey and I met with Sheriff's Lieutenant Frank Dal Porto and Sergeant Jon Sebring
with the Sheriffs Office Professional Standards Bureau who informed us the primary way to retrieve the
video from the MAV system was to bring the vehicles back to the Millbrae Substation where the videos
would automatically upload to the server once the vehicles were in the proximity of the parking lot. Due
to the fact the vehicles would need to remain in the crime scene for several hours while Forensic Lab
personnel processed the scene, Sergeant Sebring recommended having a member of the Sheriff’s Office
IT staff respond to the scene and download the video directly from the vehicles on scene so they could
be viewed by investigators prior to any interviews with involved deputies or key witnesses. Sheriff's
Office IT Technician Johnson Hang responded to the scene and was able to allow me to view the videos
on the small in-car display from each of the vehicles still at the scene and was able to retrieve the videos
from the vehicles driven by Deputy Lorenzatti and Deputy Watt without issue. Hang was unable to
retrieve the videos from the vehicles driven by Deputy Wang and Sergeant Weidner at the scene. The
video from Deputy DeMartini’s vehicle was already uploaded to the server when his vehicle was
brought back to the Millbrae Police Substation. Lieutenant Dal Porto was ultimately able to download
the videos from the MAV systems for the vehicles driven by Sergeant Weidner, Deputy Wang and
Deputy DeMartini and provided copies to me on October 5, 2018.

While at the Millbrae Police Substation meeting with IT technician Hang, Sergeant Sebring advised me
Deputy Watt was in possession of a camera which contained photographs taken at the scene. I met
briefly with Deputy Watt and took possession of his assigned camera. Deputy Watt told me he did not
personally take the pictures from the scene and told me it was his understanding it had been Deputy
Lorenzatti who had used the camera to take pictures at the scene. I then met with Sheriff's Sergeant
Szaboles Szerenyi who provided me two (2) duffle bags and a paper bag which had been in the
possession of deceased subject Okobi at the time of the contact. Sergeant Szerenyi advised me these
items were brought back to the substation by Sergeant Irfan Zaidi who would document their collection
in a report. I turned these duffle bags over to Inspector Greg Giguiere to be inventoried.

SUPPLEMENT 2 - Interview of Witness Nicole Basurto

Investigation:
On October 5, 2018 at approximately 1200 hours, I was provided information that a “Nicole” (no last

name provided) had contacted the San Mateo County District Attormey’s Office, stating that she
witnessed the incident in Millbrae from October 3, 2018. Nicole provided a call back phone number.

On October 5, 2018 at approximately 1218 hours, I called Nicole back at the listed number and
interviewed her regarding her observations of the incident in Millbrae on October 3‘4. Nicole provided
her last name as Basurto and her complete contact information during the phone interview, so she will
be referred to in this supplemental report as Witness Nicole Basurto.

(The phone interview was recorded via digital audio recording.)

At the beginning of the phone call, I told Nicole Basurto that the role of the San Mateo County District
Attorney’s Office in critical incidents, such as the one that took place in Millbrae, was to independently
investigate the incident and that I was not affiliated with the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office.

Nicole Basurto asked at the beginning of the interview if I was allowed to answer questions that she may
have regarding the incident. Basurto continued by saying that the media reports stated that the involved
subject (decedent) died at the hospital and she asked me if that was correct. I explained to Basurto that I
would be unable to answer some specific questions and that was a question that I did not feel that I could
answer. Basurto stated that the reason she asked me that question was because she did not feel like that
was correct (she did not believe the decedent died at the hospital). Basurto stated that she was “fairly
certain that he (the decedent) died on the scene.” Basurto said that after the subject was “brought to the
ground, police officers tried to sit him up and he was unresponsive.” Basurto said that she could see
that the subject was “unconscious” and she could recall the police officers leaving the subject in a
“sitting position, against the legs of an officer.” Basurto stated that she noticed that the subject’s body
was “completely limp” at that time.

Nicole Basurto said that she believed the subject was unconscious and she wasn’t certain if his heart had
stopped already at that point or if it was about to. Basurto stated that there was a man, whom she
believed may have been the owner of the tanning salon in that immediate area, who was “right there.”
Basurto said that the man brought the officers a bottle or bottles of water and they (the officers) splashed
the subject in the face with water and he did not respond. Nicole Basurto stated that a few minutes
passed and then paramedics arrived. Basurto said that she went back into her office at that point
(ultimately identified as Millbrae Dental located at 88 Capuchino Drive in Millbrae, CA) which Basurto
said was maybe half a block or less from the scene. Basurto stated that she continued watching the event
through the windows of her office. Basurto said that once paramedics arrived, she was “sure that” they
started checking the subject for a pulse and she said that one of her co-workers told her that paramedics
ripped open the subject’s shirt. Basurto stated that her sister is a nurse and she knows that when
paramedics rip open a person’s shirt, that means they are going to “start compressions because someone
isn’t breathing.”

SUPPLEMENT 2 - Interview of Witness Nicole Basurto

Basurto said that she ran back out to the area of the street and continued watching. Basurto stated that
paramedics started compressions. Basurto said that paramedics wouldn’t start compressions unless
someone isn’t breathing and Basurto stated the she “strongly believed that he (the subject) had died
already.” Basurto said that none of the officers performed CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and she
knows that police officers are trained in CPR. Basurto stated that she didn’t know if any of the police
officers “checked for a pulse” and she said, “J didn’t see that, they could have, I didn’t see that, to be
honest with you.” Basurto said that she felt that the officers could have started compressions sooner and
they did not need to wait for paramedics to arrive on scene. Basurto stated that she believed the
subject’s heart stopped either when he was brought to the ground or right before he was brought to the
ground.

I explained to Nicole Basurto that I could answer some questions that she may have in general terms. I
explained that I was not trying to be evasive with her by not directly answering her questions regarding
the timing of the subject’s death. Basurto told me that she understood. I explained to Basurto that I
wished to ask her some additional questions before I answered some of the general questions for her.

Based upon my questions, Nicole Basurto provided the following additional information:

Basurto stated that she was arriving back to work, following her lunch break and she stated, “Jt had to
be 1:00 o’clock on the dot.” Basurto said that she was headed northbound on El Camino Real, towards
Capuchino Drive (she was heading back to work at Millbrae Dental Care at 88 Capuchino Drive).
Basurto stated that she pulled up to the intersection “where you make the left onto Capuchino Drive.”
(Identified as the intersection of El Camino Real and Capuchino Drive). Basurto explained that she
stopped and she was unable to make the left hand turn onto Capuchino Drive because there were cars
headed in the southbound direction on El Camino Real and vehicles heading south were not yielding or
allowing her to turn left.

Basurto stated that she “was basically forced to sit there” as she was watching the incident. Basurto
said that she pulled forward a bit and began watching after “backup had been called” and she believed
that there were approximately five to six officers on scene at that time. Basurto stated that the five to six
officers were “kind of trying to talk to him (the subject).”” Basurto confirmed that she could not hear the
exchange of words or what was really being said, but she could see the body language. Basurto stated
that “the man looked a little scared.” Basutto said, “To be honest with you, I don’t know if he had some
type of mental disability or if he was on something, I couldn’t really tell, but I knew that he wasn’t
totally there.” Basurto stated, “At that point, it just seemed like they were trying to negotiate with him,
talk to him.” Basurto said, “When I first arrived, I thought it was the weirdest thing because he
voluntarily got on the floor.” Basurto continued, “He wasn’t on his belly, it was very odd so this is why
I’m thinking he may have been on drugs, he was on his back and he kind of just rolled onto the floor and
then rolled onto his back and police officers were just kind of watching him and puzzled, and it seemed
like they were puzzled.” Basurto said that none of the police officers approached the subject and
Basurto said, “J don’t know what police officers are trained to do in this type of situation, but I just feel

SUPPLEMENT 2 - Interview of Witness Nicole Basurto

like it would have made sense to try to make an arrest at that point, he voluntarily was on the floor,
granted I don’t know what the man was saying... maybe officers could have been thinking he had a
weapon and that’s why they didn’t want to try and arrest him at that point, but it’s just my personal take
on the situation.” Nicole Basurto stated that this was when she arrived and began watching the
situation.

Nicole Basurto confirmed that she was stationary in her car when the incident first began and she
confirmed that the initial portion started in front of the bank (Tri Counties Bank) on El Camino Real. I
confirmed with Basurto that the area in front of the bank was where she was referring to when she talked
about the subject voluntarily laying on the ground. Basurto said that there was a median in the middle of
the road and the incident first took place “across from the ATM machine” and about ten feet from the
median that separates northbound and southbound El Camino Real. Basurto stated that the officers (and
the subject) were in the middle of the southbound lanes of El Camino Real. Nicole Basurto estimated
that she was approximately fifty feet from where the officers and the subject were. Basurto stated that
she was in the opposite lanes (northbound lanes) of traffic, but she was positioned closer to the middle
of the street, as she was attempting to turn left onto Capuchino Drive.

Basurto stated that the officers “were trying to calm him (the subject) down” and she described the
subject waving his hands in gestures that she believed were consistent with him not wanting to be
touched. Basurto described this behavior occurring before she saw the subject laying on the ground
voluntarily. Basurto said that she could not hear what the officers were saying to the man but she
interpreted their body language as talking with the subject or attempting to calm him down or negotiate
with him. Basurto stated that when the subject was on the ground, there was at least one of the officers
who was trying to get him up “off the floor.” Basurto said that it looks to her as though the subject
didn’t want the officers touching him.

Basurto then stated, “To be honest, I don’t remember if they helped him get on his feet or if he got on his
feet on his own, but I do remember him struggling to get on his feet. I don’t know why, I don’t know if
he again was on drugs, I don’t know if he couldn’t breathe, he wasn’t holding his chest in any way so
there was no indication that he couldn’t breathe, but it just seemed very odd to me, his behavior was
very odd. So, he was struggling to kind of get on his feet, and then, again, I don’t remember exactly if
the officers were successful in getting him off his feet or if he did that himself.”” Basurto added, “He did
get on his feet eventually and he then started to walk away from the officers, so first he was walking
backwards, away, backwards, but still facing officers ...as soon as he turned his back on the officers, he
kind of started trying to, I guess what he felt was running, like run away, but it wasn’t running, it wasn’t
even like a light jog.” Basurto continued, “He was like a big heavyset man, so I don’t think he was
really capable of running very fast, and he started to, as soon as he turned his back on officers, I could
hear them yelling ‘stop, get on the floor, get on your stomach, get on your stomach’, and he didn’t
listen, he kept kind of running away from them.”

SUPPLEMENT 2 - Interview of Witness Nicole Basurto

Basurto stated, “So, they were kind of looped around the median, and they started coming, he started
coming in the direction towards my car and then, that’s when I kind of, I left immediately because I was
afraid that this man was going to try to get into my car.” Basurto said that she turned left and she rolled
her windows down when she first approached the incident to see if she could hear anything. Basurto
stated that she could hear the taser “go off at least two times as I was turning left.” Basurto said that she
turned left onto Capuchino Drive and she parked her car near “the bank” (Tri Counties Bank) and then
she explained, “J watched part of it through my driver’s side mirror, but at that point, I just had, I had a
feeling that something bigger was going to happen, so I got out of my car and I watched from
Capuchino Drive.”

I clarified with Nicole Basurto the positioning of her car and where she was positioned during portions
of the event. Basurto confirmed that she was essentially parked or stopped in traffic northbound on El
Camino Real (south of Capuchino Drive) during the portion of the event where the subject was on the
ground near the bank until the subject got up and began jogging towards her car. Basurto confirmed that
as the subject began jogging towards her car, she was fearful that he may attempt to get into her car, so
she moved her car forward and turned left onto Capuchino Drive at that time.

Iasked Basurto what she saw when she parked her car on Capuchino Drive and ultimately got out of her
vehicle to look. Basurto stated, “So when I got out of my car, oh my gosh.” Basurto then said that she
wrote “a lot of this down” and she “was trving to remember exactly, to be honest, I think by the time
that, you know, I think they had already gotten him on the ground, because I remember he, when he, as
he was running away, one of the officers grabbed his baton and started to hit him in the back with the
baton.” Basurto said, “As soon as that happened, he turned around and he started swinging at the
officer and I recall that he did come into contact with the officer and they kind of got into a bit of a
scuffle and when that happened, when him and that officer got into that scuffle, the rest of the officers
came and that’s when he was brought to the ground.” Basurto stated, “J’m fairly certain I watched
that through my, my um mirror.” Basurto said that the officer who swung the baton at the subject’s
back swung it “at least two, possibly three” times. Basurto clarified that was how many times the
officer’s baton “could have come into contact with the “szspect.”” Nicole Basurto stated that when “the
suspect turned around and started [swinging], he wasn’t necessarily swinging at officers with a closed
jist, it just kind of seemed like he was kind of slapping them away, but he did come in contact with the
officer, so I’m guessing that’s when the rest of the officers decided to, you know, do something and
approach the man and obviously at that point, he was being aggressive and violent and attacking one of
the officers, so they brought him to the ground.”

Basurto stated, “One of the things I feel is important to mention is that when he was on the ground, at
this point, I want to say there were six, maybe seven officers around him and they had him held on the
floor and I vividly remember one of the officers was hitting him.”” Basurto said, “I saw this man’s hand
come up and back down and I don’t know, I couldn’t see from where I was standing if he was hitting his
head or was hitting his stomach, he wouldn’t be hitting his feet, I’m assuming, um but, I do recall very

vividly that one of the officers hit him in what seemed to be his head a number of times and I want to say
he hit him anywhere between three and four times and in my perspective, I’m just trying to understand
the logic behind hitting him upside whether it was the chest, head, what have you when the suspect was
already being pinned down and held down by not one, not two, not three, not four officers, it just didn’t
make sense to me, that doesn’t feel ethically and morally correct to do that.”

I clarified with Nicole Basurto where her vantage point was for what she had just described. Basurto
estimated that she was approximately one hundred feet away and that she had turned left onto Capuchino
Drive. She stated, “J was on Capuchino Drive at this point, outside of my car.” 1 asked Basurto if she
took any photos of videos with her cell phone or any other devices. Basurto stated that she did not.

I asked Basurto for clarification on the timing of medical aid rendered to the subject, based upon her
initial concerns and statements at the beginning of the phone call. Basurto said that as she walked into
her office her boss asked her what was going on. Basurto stated that she told her boss what she had seen
and that is the same time that the paramedics arrived. Basurto said, “My co-worker said ‘oh, the
paramedics are here’, so we were watching through the window, so I wasn’t at the best vantage point to
actually see what the paramedics did upon arriving, but the next thing I know one of my colleagues said
they were cutting his shirt open and I knew that was when compressions were going to be started, so I
ran back outside and at that point, I knew, he obviously stopped breathing, prior to them arriving
because from what it seemed like, that was the first thing they were going to do was immediately start
compressions.” Basurto added, “That was an indication that the man was no longer breathing. So, I
don’t know when he stopped breathing but when officers were, so after they had him on the ground, they
tried sitting him up, but at that point, his body was completely limp and I could see that he was
unresponsive.”

Basurto added, “J didn’t know if it was because of the tasers of, I don’t know what had happened.”
Basurto stated that she saw paramedics performing CPR within “Jess than a minute of arriving.” I
asked Basurto some clarifying questions regarding he claim that she heard a taser during the incident.
Basurto stated that the officer that hit the subject with the baton, and got into the scuffle with the subject,
prior to when he was brought to the ground, that was the officer that “set the taser off from what I could
see.” Basurto explained that she believed a taser was deployed twice, based upon the sounds that she
heard and the taser(s) were deployed later in the incident. I asked Basurto for clarification on the timing
of the taser usage. Basurto said that she wasn’t sure if officers used a taser on the subject when he was
on the ground near the bank. Basurto stated that the taser(s) were used just before the officers took the
subject to the ground. Basurto specifically said that she didn’t know if any tasers were used on the
subject when he was closer to the bank and the ATM.

L asked Basurto if she saw the taser being used when she parked her car on Capuchino Drive, as that was
the point where she said she had driven away, watched part of the incident from her driver’s side mirror,
and then exited her car. Basurto said, “Oh my gosh, I can’t really remember.” Basurto stated that she

was watching part of it through her driver’s side mirror and she wasn’t sure if she saw the officer hit the
subject with the baton through her driver’s side mirror or not. Basurto stated, “Z want to say yes” that
she did see the portion of the event where the officer struck the subject with a baton through her driver’s
side mirror. Basurto said that was when the officers ran up to him and tackled him to the ground.

Basurto stated that she then walked up to the door of her workplace and kept watching from there.
Basurto said that the subject was on the ground at that point. Basurto clarifed that the taser(s) was
deployed when she was in or near the intersection and in her car. Basurto said that she rolled her vehicle
windows down and heard the first taser “go off” when she was still stationary in her vehicle. She heard
the second taser “went off” when she was turning left onto Capuchino Drive. Basurto stated that she
could hear the taser as she was turning left. I clarified with Basurto that she heard the taser deployments
after the subject had gotten up off of the ground and began jogging or running towards her vehicle.
Basurto was confident that the same officer who used his baton, and ended up struggling with the
subject, was also the same officer who utilized his taser.

I asked Basurto about any other use of force and/or other officers who may have used tasers, batons or
other weapons. Basurto stated, “No, I didn’t see that and I was actually kind of thankful that I didn’t see
anyone there with their gun drawn because I didn’t want to witness that, that would have been a little
bit, more traumatic than what I feel like I already saw.” (Basurto became emotional at this point in the
interview.)

Basurto stated that she believed some level of excessive force was used when officers took the subject to
the ground. Basurto estimated that there were approximately “six, maybe seven officers pinning him
down to the ground.” Basurto acknowledged that the subject was large by saying, “He was a heavier
set man, he was tall, he was a big guy, I could understand why they could have felt the need to have so
many officers to hold him down, but I just don’t really feel that there was a need to use that many, but
that’s the way that they decided to handle the situation.” Basurto said, “When he (the subject) was
already on the ground, like I mentioned, there was an officer that was hitting him, that was clearly
punching him, and I just didn’t understand the need for that.” Basurto added, “J wasn’t close enough
where I could hear the exchange of words, whatever, but I just didn’t feel like, it just didn’t feel right.”

I asked Nicole Basurto about notes she had written about the incident earlier in the interview. Basurto
confirmed that she wrote those notes closer in time to the event. I asked Basurto if she would be willing
to share those notes with me. Basurto responded, “Yeah, um, I mean I have them in my car.” JI
explained to Basurto the value in sending those notes along, especially since she acknowledged writing
them closer to the actual incident date. Basurto responded, “Yeah, definitely”, she would be willing to
share those notes with me.

Basurto began our phone call by sharing her belief that the subject died at the scene and not at the
hospital, which had been reported by the media. I told Basurto that I could not answer that question, or

address that specific concern regarding this case, but I could talk about it in general terms. I informed
Basurto that in San Mateo County specifically, if a person gets transported from a scene to a hospital,
that means that the person is technically still alive or has shown some signs of possible life. I explained
that a paramedic on scene has the authority to declare a person deceased and in situations where
someone is deceased on scene, paramedics would not transport that person to a hospital.

Basurto provided her personal identifying information to me at this poit in the interview. I asked
Basurto if she knew of anyone else who saw significant portions of the event that she felt I should speak
with. Basurto responded, “No, honestly no.” Basurto stated that there was a guy who “seemed to be
very involved in the scene, ... it looked like it was the owner from.... the tanning salon which was across
Jrom where everything happened.” Basurto said that person was wearing a black t shirt and khaki shorts
and a hat. Basurto said that it seemed odd to her that this person was “so involved”, as he provided one
of the officers a towel and he handed them water. Basurto stated, “He would be a good person to talk
to.” (That person was identified as Dennis Barboza and he had already been interviewed by
investigators). I told Basurto that in general terms, there was a good likelihood that we had already
interviewed that person.

I provided Basurto my direct contact information and asked if she could scan in her initial notes and
send them to me via email. I assured Basurto that her personal information (date of birth, home address
and phone number) would be redacted out in the public release of the final report. I asked Basurto if
there was anything else she would like to add or felt that I had not asked. Basurto replied, “No.” I let
Basurto know that if she had any problems scanning in her original notes, I would have an investigator
pick them up from her.

As of October 12, 2018, I had not received Nicole Basurto’s initial notes via email. On October 12,
2018, I sent a letter to Nicole Basurto at her home address, along with a pre-addressed, postage-paid
envelope, asking her to email the notes to me or send a copy back in the enclosed envelope. (Please refer
to attached letter- Follow up Letter to Nicole Basurto)

As of November 20, 2018, I have not received any email, return envelope or phone call from Nicole
Basurto with or about her initial notes.

Investigation:

On October 3, 2018, I was the on-scene Officer Involved Critical Incident Team Supervisor for the event
that occurred in Millbrae at approximately 1301 hours. Due to the fairly large area that the scene
covered, I requested assistance from the Menlo Park Fire Department, specifically due to ther UAS/
Drone capabilities. Menlo Park Fire Department Captain Chris Dennebaum ultimately responded to the
scene in Millbrae, along with a second Menlo Park Firefighter. MPFD Captain Dennebaum secured all
of the necessary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) clearances to launch the MPFD UAS/Drone
over the scene.

Captain Dennebaum took a total of 46 digital photographs and 2 videos of the incident scene, utilizing
the UAS/Drone. Captain Dennebaum provided me with a digital storage card that contained those 46
photos and 2 videos. I uploaded those photos and videos to the digital case file on a server at the San
Mateo County District Attorney’s Office. (SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02, Evidence

that occurred in Millbrae at approximately 1301 hours. During the afternoon, I had telephone
conversations with association representatives and/or attorneys who represented the involved San Mateo
County Sheriff's Office Deputies and Sergeant.

I spoke with San Mateo County Deputy Sheriff's Association President, DJ Wozniak regarding a request
for voluntary blood draws from San Mateo County Sheriff's Deputies Demartini, Lorenzatti, Watt and
Wang. Wozniak told me that he had been in contact with attomeys from Mastagni Holstedt, who

Burdick represented Sergeant David Weidner, as he is a member of the San Mateo County Organization
of Sheriff's Sergeants. Sarah Burdick stated that it is the policy of her law firm not to provide voluntary
blood samples and as such, Sergeant Weidner would not provide a voluntary blood sample out of this
incident.

SUPPLEMENT 5 - Interview of Witness Paul Neily PEACE SO2

Investigation:
I was given contact information from Deputy Pedro Miqueo regarding a potential witness (Paul Neily)

who is a Millbrae Public Works employee who may have witnessed part of the incident. I met with Paul
Neily at a Public Works shop located in Central Park in Millbrae. This interview took place on October
5, 2018 at approximately 11:10 AM. The interview was audio recorded with Neily’s knowledge. Below
is Paul Neily’s paraphrased statement.

Statement of Paul Neily:
In the beginning of the interview, Paul Neily volunteered that after the incident occurred, he discovered

the man involved (decedent) was Chinedu Okobi. Neily said he knew Okobi from high school and they
had even played football and soccer together. Neily said he hadn’t seen Okobi in the last 10-15 years and
at the time of the incident he didn’t even know Okobi was involved because of the dramatic physical
changes in Okobi’s appearance since the last time he had seen him.

Paul Neily told me he is a Senior Maintenance Worker for the City of Millbrae. Neily reported he has
been working for the City of Millbrae for approximately 14 years. On the day of the incident, Neily said
he was driving northbound on El Camino Real in a Public Works vehicle. Neily was headed to South
San Francisco to pick up some rain gear and rain boots for some co-workers. While Neily was stopped
in his truck in the far-left lane at a red light, he noticed a Sheriff's Office pickup truck stopped in the far-
right northbound lane of El Camino Real at Millwood Ave. Neily noted that the light bar was turned on
the Sheriff's Office truck.

Paul Neily said he first saw Decedent Okobi when the traffic signal turned green. Okobi was wearing a
blue shirt with possibly gray pants. Neily said Okobi was in the center island median of El Camino Real
near the Tri-Counties Bank. Neily remarked that Okobi looked as though he was already in a
confrontation with a deputy and was back pedaling. Neily then saw a tall Asian deputy, with his baton
out, saying something to Okobi. Neily confirmed he couldn’t hear what the deputy was saying to Okobi.
Neily saw the Asian deputy swing the baton at Okobi and saw that the baton grazed Okobi’s stomach.
Neily said Okobi then charged at the deputy, knocking the baton out of the deputy’s hand. Neily said the
deputy and Okobi then got tangled up in a struggle, “kind of like wrestling.”

During this time, other deputies joined in and Decedent Okobi went down to the ground. At this point,
Paul Neily was still sitting in his truck, and he saw one of the deputies get up and it looked as though the
deputy had been pepper sprayed. Neily exited his truck and got a water bottle for the deputy. Neily
estimated that he was approximately 5 to 10 yards from where Okobi went down to the ground. Neily
added that one or two additional deputies also got pepper sprayed and he supplied them with water as
well.

Paul Neily said the deputies ultimately got Decedent Okobi handcuffed and rolled Okobi over. Neily
remembered that the deputies reported that Okobi had a pulse and that he was alive. Neily also heard the
deputies call on the radio for backup and fire and ambulance. Neily estimated that there was 4 or 5

deputies involved in the incident. Neily confirmed that he did not see anyone use the Taser on Okobi.

Once Decedent Okobi was secured in handcuffs Paul Neily asked one of the deputies if he needed to
stay. The deputy told him that he needed to provide a statement about what he had seen. Neily then
moved his truck and one of the deputies (possibly Deputy Demartini) obtained his statement.

400 COUNTY CENTER, 3RD FLOOR +~REDWOOD CITY, CA 94063 650-363-4636 fisci0-c2 |
INVESTIGATION:
I was given contact information from Deputy Pedro Miqueo regarding a witness (Robert Garrison) who
had a video recording of the incident. I called Garrison and set up an interview with him. I met Garrison
at his parent’s house at I. This interview took place on October 3, 2018 at
approximately 1630 hours. The interview was audio recorded with Garrison’s knowledge. Below is
Robert Garrison’s paraphrased statement.

STATEMENT OF ROBERT GARRISON:

Robert Garrison reported that it was between 1:00PM and 1:30PM and he was at the teller stand inside
the bank (Tri Counties Bank) across from where the incident with the deputies took place. Garrison
heard some of the bank tellers start to yell. When Garrison tumed around to see what was happening he
saw two police cars stop nearby. Garrison walked over to the window of the bank and that’s when he
saw the man (Decedent Chinedu Okobi). Garrison said, “He looked really crazy, he was just going
around like he was going to fight somebody, and that’s when they tased him, and that’s when I pulled
my phone out.”

Robert Garrison said the first video he recorded was when Decedent Okobi was on the ground being
tased. Garrison said in the next videos you see Okobi “squirming around a little bit, still resisting and
had his hands up, ripped the tase off, got up, got tased a second time, body went into shock, fell and then

I didn’t see him when he was behind the cop car.”

Robert Garrison continued, “But when I moved I see the Decedent Okobi get up again and started
running east towards northbound El Camino and in between the time of videos where he dragged one of
the officers down to the ground, umm, resisting and assaulting the officer and then when he got up again
in one of the videos you’ll see he throws a punch, it’ll be on the right side of the video, throws a punch
and then throws another one and that’s when he got dragged to the ground, and then there’s videos of
him being subdued on the ground.”

I confirmed with Robert Garrison that he recorded the video with his iPhone and it was all obtained from
inside the bank right up against the window. Tri Counties Bank is located at 1551 El Camino Real in
Millbrae. The bank is on the west side of El Camino Real with the front of the bank facing east. The
bank is located between Santa Helena Avenue to the north and Capuchino Drive to the south.

When Robert Garrison first saw Decedent Okobi, Okobi was on the sidewalk nearest southbound El
Camino Real. Initially he saw about three officers near Okobi, then Okobi moved to the roadway on
southbound El Camino Real. Garrison said it looked to him as though Okobi was running from the
officers and had ripped off his sweater “like he was getting ready to fight or flee.” Garrison explained
that was when Okobi was tased the first time. Okobi, Garrison said, was tased by the “tall, Asian
American officer.” Garrison said Okobi fell to the ground and looked like he was trying to get up. As the
deputies were trying to approach him and get him to cooperate and “maybe arrest him” but Okobi was
moving around a lot.

SUPPLEMENT 6 - Interview of Witness Robert Garrison io

Decedent Okobi appeared to rip off the taser (probes) before getting up from the ground. As Okobi got
up, he swung and knocked the glasses off of “a short, Caucasian officer.” After Okobi got up and
knocked the glasses off the officer, Okobi was tased a second time. Garrison explained that Okobi went
down to the ground again and that’s when Garrison moved to view the incident from a different vantage
point.

Robert Garrison couldn’t see anything else until Decedent Okobi got up a second time. After Okobi got
up the second time, he started walking (light jogging) away from the officers; first south, then east
towards the northbound lanes of El Camino Real. Robert Garrison said that Okobi had moved to the
northbound lanes of El Camino Real when he saw him grab the tall Asian officer “probably around the
neck area and drag him onto the ground.” Okobi also went to the ground then got back up and walked
back into the southbound lanes of El Camino Real. The Asian officer got up, followed Okobi, and that’s
when Okobi punched the Asian officer in the face. Okobi threw another punch as the team of officers
brought Okobi to the ground. Garrison said there was a lot of “squirming” on the ground for what he
estimated to be 5 to 10 minutes. Finally, Okobi looked subdued and was handcuffed. Garrison then saw
fire personnel and an ambulance arrive. Garrison stopped video recording after Okobi had been
successfully handcuffed, and his shirt was up. Garrison reported that Okobi was sitting up and “looked
like he was conscious for sure.” Garrison noted that it looked like Okobi was being loaded onto a gurney
when he left.

Robert Garrison described Decedent Okobi as, “Very large, 6 feet or taller, heavy build, African
American, weight maybe 270.” Garrison said Okobi had been wearing blue jeans and a blue sweater,
which he ripped off before Garrison started the recording, and a blue or gray shirt underneath the
sweater. Garrison further estimated Okobi as being 38-45 years old with medium length hair.

The only time Robert Garrison heard anything being said during the incident was before Decedent Okobi
got teased the first time. More specifically, Garrison heard a tall, bald, heavy, Caucasian male officer
telling Okobi to stay still, and telling him to comply before the taser deployment.

Iasked Robert Garrison if all the deputies were in full uniform and he said, “Yes, all in full uniform.”

I asked Robert Garrison if he saw the deputies use any other type of force during the incident. Garrison
said he saw the tall deputy he described as Caucasian, stocky, bald officer use the baton. Garrison
clarified that he saw that specific officer hit Decedent Okobi once with the baton, but Okobi walked off
and it appeared to him as though Okobi didn’t feel anything. Garrison said he didn’t see anyone use any
pepper spray and didn’t see any officers draw a firearm.

Robert Garrison voluntarily sent me the videos he had recorded of the incident from his iPhone.
Garrison provided me with a total of six video recordings. Garrison explained that he stopped and

SUPPLEMENT 7 - Interview of Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti

INTERVIEW WITH INVOLVED OFFICER ALYSSA LORENZATTI:

On October 4, 2018 at approximately 3:50 PM, I interviewed San Mateo County Sheriff's Office
Deputy, Alyssa Lorenzatti, in the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office Interview room. Deputy
Lorenzatti was an involved officer in the Officer Involved Critical Incident (OICI) on October 3, 2018.
Present in the interview room was Attorney Zebulon Davis, from the Law Firm of Mastagni Holstedt,
representing Deputy Lorenzatti. I explained to Deputy Lorenzatti the investigation process and advised
her that the interview was being audio and video recorded. I confirmed with Deputy Lorenzatti that she
was consenting to the interview, that she was not being ordered to provide a statement, that her
statements were free and voluntary, and that she was free to leave at any time. Deputy Lorenzatti
acknowledged this by saying, “Yes sir.” Attorney Davis concurred.

Prior to the interview, Deputy Lorenzatti along with Attorney Davis watched the MAV Video recording
of the incident that was captured from her assigned patrol vehicle. Deputy Lorenzatti and Attomey Davis
also viewed a video taken by civilian witness Robert Garrison from inside of the Tri-Counties Bank
located at 1551 El Camino Real in Millbrae. The video taken by Garrison was shown to Deputy
Lorenzatti without audio, the MAV was shown with audio. The following is a synopsis of the interview:

PERSONAL/WORK HISTORY:

Deputy Lorenzatti has been in law enforcement for approximately 5 years; 2 years with the San Mateo
County Sheriff's Office and prior to that she spent 3 years with the California Highway Patrol (CHP).
Deputy Lorenzatti has worked for the Special Response Team (Riot Unit) for the CHP, is certified as a
Drug Recognition Expert, trained in Crisis Intervention Training (CIT), and has worked various
assignments for the Sheriff's Office including the jail, headquarters patrol, and is currently assigned to
patrol in the City of Millbrae.

Deputy Lorenzatti is currently assigned to Patrol Team 1 and works a 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM shift with
rotating days on/off. Today’s shift was her first day back at work. She confirmed there were no unusual
or high intensity calls for service prior to this incident. Deputy Lorenzatti was easily identifiable as a
police officer. Deputy Lorenzatti said the uniform she was wearing on this day was her Sheriff’s Office
department issued navy wool pants and navy short sleeve shirt. The uniform shirt had Sheriff's Office
patches on both arms and she was wearing her badge.

Deputy Lorenzatti was wearing a black duty belt and is right handed. On her duty belt Deputy Lorenzatti
carried her duty firearm (Glock 19), ASP collapsible baton, 2 Glock magazines, radio holder with radio,
2 sets of handcuffs and her department issued Taser. Deputy Lorenzatti was driving a fully marked,
black and white, San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office vehicle. The vehicle is a Ford Taurus and the
vehicle number is #8.

INCIDENT:

On October 4, 2018, Deputy Lorenzatti was on duty and was at the Millbrae Police Substation at 581
Magnolia Avenue in Millbrae. She was in the report writing room when she heard Deputy Wang on the
radio say he was going out on a subject. Deputy Wang then called for Code 3 cover, stating that
someone was running in the traffic lanes on northbound El Camino Real at Millwood Drive.

SUPPLEMENT 7 - Interview of Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti

Deputy Lorenzatti wasn’t exactly sure what was happening, but she ran out to her patrol car to respond.
Deputy Lorenzatti saw Sgt. Weidner and Deputy Watt heading to their cars as well. Deputy Lorenzatti
activated her lights and siren and headed to the scene. As Deputy Lorenzatti was approaching the scene
she saw Decedent Okobi. Deputy Lorenzatti described Okobi as a large black male adult with a blue
shirt running in traffic, across the lanes of Northbound El Camino Real to south El Camino Real. Deputy
Lorenzatti was approaching the scene from the south heading north on northbound El Camino Real.
Deputy Lorenzatti estimated it took her between 30 seconds to 1 minute to arrive at the incident scene.

To get the best access to the Decedent Okobi, Deputy Lorenzatti started to drive on the wrong side of El
Camino Real, against traffic, making sure all the other vehicles could see her coming that way. Deputy
Lorenzatti stopped, parked her patrol vehicle in the southbound lanes of El Camino Real and exited out
of her vehicle. Deputy Lorenzatti noted Deputy Wang’s vehicle up ahead of her, further north, making a
U-turn to come back southbound on El Camino Real. When Deputy Lorenzatti exited her vehicle Okobi,
who she described as over 6 feet tall and 300 Ibs., was now about 25 yards away from her and walking
towards her. Okobi was carrying 2 large black bags in his hands. At this point they were both on the
south sidewalk of El Camino Real. When Okobi was approximately 10-15 feet away from her, Deputy
Lorenzatti told Okobi to stop and to put the bags down. Okobi said something to the effect of, “I didn’t
do nothing” or “I didn’t do anything.” Deputy Lorenzatti told Okobi to stop again. Okobi stared at
Deputy Lorenzatti but continued to walk straight towards her.

Deputy Lorenzatti said, “It felt like he was just going to run me over if I didn’t get out his way, he was
going to walk right through me and barrel me over." Deputy Lorenzatti continued, “He had this look in
his eyes, that he wasn’t quite all there. He seemed like he might have been under the influence of
something. I wasn’t sure.”

Deputy Lorenzatti said the Decedent Okobi still wasn’t listening and kept walking towards her so she
sidestepped him and went to grab his left arm. She explained that she attempted to apply a control hold
on Okobi and tried to detain him. She did this based on the code 3 cover call, the information that Okobi
was walking through traffic, and the fact that Okobi was not listening to any of her verbal commands.
Okobi pulled away from her attempt at a control hold and continued traveling past her. Deputy
Lorenzatti tried to grab his arm again but he flung his arms up in the air.

Deputy Lorenzatti said Decedent Okobi was actively resisting her efforts to detain him and she thought
he needed to go down to the ground for her better gain control of him. Okobi was too big to physically
control and nothing she had used so far had been effective. Deputy Lorenzatti was afraid for her safety
and felt that someone was really going to get hurt. Deputy Lorenzatti thought Okobi might be too big to
just take down to the ground so she attempted to sweep his leg out but it didn’t work. Okobi was now
waving his arms wildly in the air and swinging his fists. Deputy Lorenzatti heard Deputy Wang tell
Okobi to stop or he was going to be tased. Deputy Wang gave Okobi multiple warnings and Okobi didn't
saying anything that she could understand or remember. Deputy Lorenzatti said Okobi was, “kind of

dancing around” and then Okobi went down to the ground as he was tased by Deputy Wang.

When Decedent Okobi went down to the ground, Deputy Lorenzatti planned on moving in quickly to
handcuff him, but he fell away from her and by the time she got to him he had already rolled over onto
his back. The deputies gave Okobi multiple verbal commands to roll over onto his stomach and at one-
point Deputy Lorenzatti even tried to grab the Okobi's arm to help initiate getting him onto his stomach.
That didn’t work, and Okobi then grabbed at Deputy Lorenzatti’s legs.Decedent Okobi continued to
ignore their commands to turn over on his stomach.

At one point Decedent Okobi jumped up (she recalled this from watching the video footage) and got
tased a second time by Deputy Wang. Okobi went down to the ground again but quickly got up again
and started running away. Deputy Wang got in front of Okobi drew his ASP baton out. She heard
Deputy Wang yell to Okobi to stop and saw Deputy Wang swing his ASP baton at him a few times; she
didn’t see how many times he swung or if he connected his blows. Deputy Lorenzatti said that Okobi
seemed fixated on Deputy Wang. Deputy Lorenzatti saw Okobi swing at Deputy Wang and she didn’t
know if the Okobi hit him or not. Then out of the corner of her eyes, and to her left, Deputy Lorenzatti
saw another deputy (unsure who) tackle Okobi to the ground. Deputy Lorenzatti jumped onto Okobi
while he continued to fight and kick and not give up his hands despite continued commands from the
deputies, “Give us your hands, give us your hands, stop resisting.” It was then that Deputy Lorenzatti
was sprayed in the face with pepper spray.

Deputy Lorenzatti wasn’t sure where the pepper spray came from but she confirmed that Decedent
Okobi was still fighting with them at this point. Deputy Lorenzatti was blinded from the pepper spray
but she put all her body weight onto Okobi and clamped down on her right side to prevent Okobi from
trying to access her firearm.

Deputy Lorenzatti told me she never deployed her ASP baton because she felt Decedent Okobi was too
strong and would have likely taken the ASP baton away from her. Deputy Lorenzatti reported that
Okobi was still fighting and they didn’t have control of him yet. Deputy Lorenzatti thought that if she
could punch Okobi “in a soft spot, maybe it’ll jolt his arm out.” Deputy Lorenzatti remembered
punching at the Okobi's lower half of his body but her blows were not effective. Deputy Lorenzatti then
grabbed her handcuffs and handed them to someone, she didn’t know who. She remained in her
position, on the lower half of the Okobi's body, until she heard that he was in handcuffs.

During the time when the deputies were trying to handcuff Decedent Okobi, Deputy Lorenzatti heard
Sgt. Weidner call for medics. She confirmed this occurred before the Okobi was fully detained
(handcuffed). Deputy Lorenzatti remembered Okobi getting rolled onto his side ultimately moved into a
sitting position after being handcuffed. When the medics arrived, Deputy Lorenzatti remembered them
checking Okobi's pulse and at that time the he had a pulse. She said at some point Okobi stopped
responding to pain stimulus and the medics put him down onto his back and started CPR.

SUPPLEMENT 7 - Interview of Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti

I asked Deputy Lorenzatti if she had sustained any injuries during the incident. She said she received
minor scraps on her right wrist and the top of her right forearm. She didn’t remember how those injuries
occurred but knew they were fresh injuries from the incident. Deputy Lorenzatti said she didn’t seek or
need medical attention for those injuries, she just received water at the scene to flush her eyes out from
the pepper spray exposure. I asked Deputy Lorenzatti if she received any damage to her uniform or her
personal protective equipment. Deputy Lorenzatti advised that her right shirt pocket had a small rip in it
before the incident occurred and the rip was larger after the incident. Also, her right front pants pocket
now had a small rip in it as well.

I asked Deputy Lorenzatti if she had consumed any alcohol within the prior 24 hours before her shift.
Deputy Lorenzatti said that she had two beers at approximately 6PM to 7PM the prior night. I asked
Deputy Lorenzatti if she took any medications at the time of the incident. Deputy Lorenzatti said she
might have taken an over the counter [J medicine J the night before but wasn’t sure.

Deputy Lorenzatti told me that she has successfully used her CIT training during past incidents and I
asked her if she felt that CIT could have been used in this situation. Deputy Lorenzatti said, “No.
Everything happened very fast, and from the moment I got on scene, he wasn’t listening to anything we
said, and he was becoming more and more of a risk to the public and us as it went on”.

I asked Deputy Lorenzatti if she recognized Decedent Okobi and she said she did not recognize Okobi
and she did not recall any prior contacts with the Okobi.

At the end of the interview I asked Deputy Lorenzatti and Attorney Zebulon Davis if they had any
questions. Deputy Lorenzatti and Attorney Zebulon Davis had no questions.

Okay.
So when you started shift that day you felt - you felt fine? No...
Yes.

..no issues? Okay. Um, talk a little bit about what kind of calls that you had
handled prior to, uh, the incident happening.

Um, so I got into work and I was ready to go by 5:30 and, uh, Deputy Wang
got called to a, uh, like, a noise complaint. Um, well, the night shift did but we
were already ready to go so we took if for them so they could go home.
Okay.

Um, at Starbucks, right down the street, so Deputy Wang and I just walked
over there and, um, talked to that guy and told him - he was using a leaf
blower p- too early, so we just told him to stop.

Okay.

And then, uh, went back to the station. Um, and then we had briefing, and
then after briefing, um, I had a - think it was - it was a - a la- uh, a neighbor
had called about - her resident left a gate open or found it open.

Mm-hm.

She had found it open the day before, closed it, saw it open again, thought it
was suspicious, So...

Okay.

Uh, we went out there and did a walk around the house, closed the gate.
Everything was secure. Uh, then I had training at the, uh, range.

Okay.
From 8:00 to - I think we got around 11:30ish.
Okay.

Um, driving training, and then from there, uh, went back to the substation, ate
lunch, uh, and then the - this incident happened.

Okay. So during none of those calls and n- to you were any type-high stress

calls?
No.

Okay. And then prior to that, uh, you were on your off days, but do you
remember any high-stress calls during that week prior?

Mm.
Anything out of the ordinary?
No.

Okay. So what I want you to do now is just kind of, uh, remember back to the
incident itself and then just kinda do a free-flow narrative, starting from where
you were, what was dispatched, and then just kinda go through the whole
incident, and then what happened after. Okay?

Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Uh, so we just finished eating lunch in the briefing room. I
was in the report writing room, working on a, uh, stolen vehicle report I had
taken the prior week. Um, when I heard, uh, Deputy Wang go on the radio,
um, uh, he said something to the effect of he was going out with a subject, uh,
and then I heard him call for Code 3 Cover. There was someone running in the
lanes.

Okay.

So I wasn’t super certain what was going on.

Mm-hm.

Um, I know that when people are running in and out of lanes it’s not usually a
good sign, and he called for Code 3 Cover, so...

Right.

Iran out to my patrol car. I think, uh, Sergeant Weidner was right behind me,
followed by Deputy Watt.

Okay.
I’m not sure of the order but that’s just what I remember seeing as I ran out.

Um, got out my car, um, got to the gate, threw on my lights and s- siren, came
on, and headed to the scene.

Mm-hm.

Uh, got there. Um, as I was approaching the scene I could see, um, it was, uh,
a large black male adult with a blue shirt running across El Camino. Um...

Okay.

I think he was on the northbound side, or just crossing from the northbound
side to the southbound side when I got on-scene.

Okay.

Um, so I, um, started to go on the wrong way of traffic, made sure all the
vehicles saw that I was coming that way.

Mm-hm.
Parked my patrol car and got out. Um, at this point the - the male was walking
towards me and, um, confirmed that he was very large, probably - on my

estimate when I got there, I was thinking he was, like, 300 pounds and over
six feet tall.

Okay.
Un, he started walking towards me. I told him to stop.
Mm-hm.

I think he said something like, “I didn’t - I didn’t do nothin’,” or, “I didn’t do
anything.” I d- don’t know the exact verbiage he used.

Yeah.

Told him to stop again. Um, I don’t remember how many times. I know it was
multiple times.

Mm-hm.
Un, he just kinda stared at me and kept walking towards me and it felt like he

was gonna just run me over if I didn’t, uh, get out of the way. Had this look in
his eyes just like...

Okay.
He wasn’t quite - wasn’t quite all there.
Mm-hm.

Um, he seemed like he might be under the influence of something. I wasn’t
really sure.

Okay.

I just know he wasn’t listening to what I was saying. Um, so I went to grab
his, um, left arm and then he pulled away, and I remember him - his hands in
the air and I remember more people coming and I remember trying to grab
him again, and he’s still, like, flailing his hands in the air and I’m, um, before
that, I think as I was grabbing his left arm...

Mm-hm.
Sorry, I just kinda remembered it again.
Sure.

He had a bunch of bags, and I told him to put ‘em down and, uh, he wasn’t -
and the same time I was telling him to stop, I was telling him, “Put it down.”

Right.

He didn’t put anything down. I didn’t know what was in the bags, if he was
gonna swing ‘em at us, if he was gonna grab something in there that could be
a weapon, so I grabbed them, threw them on the ground and, um, you know,
couldn’t get his hand ‘cause he pulled it away and, uh, so then more of us
came in. We were trying to grab him. Um, at this point I was like, I - he needs
to go to the ground, he’s y- actively resisting.

Mm-hm.

I thought, “I’m not gonna be able to - he’s big. None of us are gonna be able
to fight him, like...”

Right.
“Standing up,” so I went to - I tried to attempt, like, a leg sweep.

I - it was unsuccessful. I don’t remember if I made contact with his leg or not.
I know I tried to get the back of his leg so he’d get down.

Right.

Um, he just started throwing his hands wildly. I heard Deputy Wang say,
“Stop, we’re gonna Tase you.” Um, I don’t - you know, it was several times. I
don’t remember how many times he said it.

Mm-hm.

Um, the gentleman was still fighting, say- y- I don’t - I couldn’t understand
what he was saying. It was - it wasn’t - I couldn’t just un- understand him.

Sure.

He was just goin’ on and, um, kinda, like, almost, like, dancing around, like,
jumping around kinda, just - it was really weird.

Okay.

And, uh, um, then he gets Tased. Um, he went to the ground. I tried to, um,
based on my training I know it’s a good idea to try and handcuff someone
while they’re under power.

Mm-hm.

Um, but he fell a little bit away from me, and I tried to get to him, and he, by
then, already rolled over on his back.

Okay.

Tried to get him to get onto his stomach. We gave him several commands,
“Get on your stomach - get on your stomach.” I think I even - I tried grabbing
his arm to roll him over, but he was a lot bigger than me, so that didn’t work,
either.

Okay.

And he started grabbing at my leg- like, just flailing his hands and then...
Mm-hm.

At some point he was kinda just layin’ there with his hands up and, like,

behind him, but, like, he wa- he just wouldn’t do what we said, “Get on your
stomach - get on your stomach.” He wouldn’t do it. At one point he jumped
up, uh, and this is gonna be more memory from the video.

Mm-hm.

Um, I remember him jumping up a bunch of times but, th- like, at this point,
this is where the video...

Sure.
..teflected my r- or r- helped with my recollection.
Okay.

He, like, jumped up and then got Tased again. Um, and he went down again.
Um, but I don’t - shortly after that he got up again and started running away.
Uh, Deputy Wang, I think, got in front of him. Um, I saw Deputy Wang take
his ASP out and swing it a few times. I didn’t see how many times, or where
he connected. I was just trying to get in a position to try and, uh, kinda help
whatever I could. He seemed really fixated on Deputy Wang at that point.

Mm-hm.

Um, and then outta the corner of my eye I saw another deputy. I c- I didn’t
know at the time who it was -- um, and I’m actually not even still sure -- just
come from my left and just tackle him.

Mm-hm.

So then I jumped on him and he was still fighting and kicking, wouldn’t give
us his hands. We’re giving him commands, “Give us your hands.” Um, you
know, “Stop resisting,” I don’t remember the exa- I just know there was a lot
of - a lot of talking, a lot of instructions and, uh, then all of a sudden I got hit
in the face with pepper spray. Wasn’t really sure where it came from.

Okay.

Um, and I couldn’t see and I was, you know, at that point I just - he was still
fighting, so I just put all my body weight, um, on him and I, like, clamped
down on my right side...

Mm-hm.

grab my gun or someone else’s gun so I was like, “I - I can’t see, I can’t go a
lot, so I’m just...”

Sure.

““.gonna put all my weight on him and hope that at least where I’m at he
doesn’t do anything.”

Okay.

Um, grabbed my handcuffs, handed ‘em to somebody, don’t know who. Um,
and I just - seriously just - I just stayed there until they said, you know, “We
got him in cuffs,” and heard our sergeant through the whole thing - I think
before we even had him completely detained, called for medics. Um, uh,
eventually he just stopped fighting and then he was handcuffed and, you

know, I rinsed my face off and, uh, medics came on-scene.

Okay. So when you got, uh, dispatched, how many people do you think were
going to the call and - do you know?

Um, I remember for sure it was, um, three of us...

Mm.

Mm. Okay. And then when you were en-route to the call, did you hear any
updates? You heard a call for - for Code 3 cover, and then did you hear
anything else on the way there?

Um, I heard north, like, that he was northbound on El Camino.

Okay.

Did you know what - what you were going there for at that point?

Mm, maybe f- he was pro- tryin’ to think. I’m not great with, uh, estimations
on distances sometimes. Um, maybe 25 yards.

Okay. And did he see you immediately?

I’m not sure.

Okay. So then you started to approach him on foot.
Mm-hm.

Um, at that point when you got outta the car and th- started to approach him,
where was Deputy Wang at that point?

I don’t know.

Okay.

I didn’t - I didn’t...

You didn’t see him?

Mm-mm.

Okay. And as you were approaching, when did you get his attention?

Um, he was maybe - I mean, I was right in the middle of the sidewalk and he
was right in the middle of the sidewalk, so maybe, like, te- I don’t know, 10
feet away is my best guess. 10, 15 feet away.

Okay. And what’s the first thing you said to him?

Um, I said, “Stop,” and s- what I remember saying. I just remember sayin’,
“Stop.”

Okay. So at that point, he acknowledged you and did he say anything at that
time?

Yeah. I don’t remember the order of when he said it, but I do remember him
saying, “I didn’t do anything.” Something to that effect. And I said, “Well,
hey, just stop.”

Okay.

Um, “Put your stuff down,” that s- started - ‘cause he (jus-) never stopped

walking. He just kept walking forward towards me.

Okay.

So at that point I was just tryin’ to tell him just, “Hey, stop - stop.”

Okay.

Yeah.

So then you attempted to go hands-on by grabbing his arm.

Yes.

Okay. And that’s when you said he kinda pulled away?

Yes.

Okay. And then at what point did Deputy Wang get there to assist you?

He was there pretty much as soon as - ‘cause I knew everyone was close, so -
so as soon as I grabbed him arm, everyone was pretty much right there. I don’t
know.

Okay. So at that time, there was other deputies there, as well?

Mm-hm.

Okay. Do you remember who was there with you?

Um, n- I mean, no, not...

Okay.

..exactly.

And then at that time, where were you standing? Were you still in the same
location when - when everybody arrived, or had you moved at all?

I moved behind him.
Okay.

Kind of, like, when I grabbed hi- went to - when I went to grab his hand I
kinda stepped to the side so that he wouldn’t, like, run me over.

Okay.

Or hit me or anything, and I went to grab his hand and then that’s when he f-
kind of came away, and I went around the back of him.

Okay. So, uh, so how many deputies do you estimate are around him at that
point?

Uh, I think there were, like, four of us.
Okay. And was he standing or was he on the ground?
He was standing.

Okay. So what happened next, then? What happened to - what escalated to the
- to the - to the next level after that?

Um, like I said, I think I tried to do, like, a legs-type sweep thing.

Mm-hm.

Tryin’ to get him to the ground, and he just started swinging his hands. I saw
him, like, I - from what I remember, I saw him, like, swinging his fist around
and I heard, “Stop, you’re gonna get Tased,” and, um, I thought for sure one
of us was about to get hit in the face or get hit somewhere and get...

Right.

...hurt, and then I - and then he got, um, Tased and then...

Okay. So you heard the warning, the a- admonishment, uh, of the Taser.
Mm-hm.

And then you saw the Taser being deployed.

Yeah.

Do you remember who was doing that?

Uh, it was Deputy Wang.

Okay. So Deputy Wang does the Taser.

Okay. And did you see the Taser hit him?

Um, I don’t really rem...

Did...

I mean, I saw him falling. I don’t remember if I saw the Taser itself...
Okay.

. hit him.

So do you - do you think he fell in - in your mind, did he fall in reaction to
bein’ - to bein’ hit with the Taser?

Yes.

Okay. And did his body have any type of visible reaction, or did he make any
type of noise?

Um, I saw his body lock up like it was a, um, like, a successful Taser hit.
Okay.

And - and he just fell over.

Okay. And then what happened from that point, then?

That’s when I tried to go get him in handcuffs while he was still on a - I th- I
mean, I remember, you know, tryin’ to get him under power.

Mm-hm.
And - and he rolled over on his back and then, um, I remember him, like, just
swinging his arms at us, and then it stopped for a minute, and just giving him

commands to get on his stomach and him not getting on his stomach.

Okay. So then, um, the deputies - you and the deputies are around him. He’s
still in the street. Now, he’s on his back.

Mm-hm.
Okay. And then what happens from there?

Um, that’s where, like, th- everything starts to kinda, like, I d- didn’t
remember, really, the order until I saw the video.

Okay.

Um, I remember, like, you know, “Stop, get on your stomach, you’re gonna
get,” you know...

Mm-hm.

I- [remember, like, hearing something about - I don’t know if it was, “You’re
gonna get Tased again,” or, ““Tase him again,” or - or something. Um, but then
he jumped up and then that’s when he got Tased again. He locked up again
and...

Okay.

.-fell down.

So that second time - so when - when he gets up after he gets Tased the first

time, um, does he move from his location or is he in the same location where
he got Tased the first time?

Um, I think he went forward a little bit. I know he, like, jumped. I remember
thinking he was gonna grab my leg, so I jumped back, and then he got
shocked again and he, like, fell down.

He f- he went down again?

Yeah.

Okay. So this is the second Tase, a- and you believe it’s the same deputy.
Yes.

It’s Deputy Wang, still?

Okay. So he goes down a second time, he falls down on the ground, and from
your recollection you’re still in the - the southbound lanes of El Camino?

Yes.

Okay. And then what happened from there?

And then he gets up again and starts running, um, and I remember I pulled out
my Taser, like, thinking I might need to Tase him again. I didn’t have a great
shot.

Mm-hm.

It was kinda far, and then Deputy Wang at some point got in front of him
while I was behind him, so I put it back. Um, and then that’s when I saw
Deputy Wang with his, uh, his ASP Baton out.

Okay.

Um, swinging, telling him, “Stop,” you know...

So it - and you said he took off, which - which direction was the suspect going
from there?

He started running from - at, like, a diagonal angle, sort of, uh, south.
Okay.

And then ended up in, uh, southbound - the southbound lanes of traffic, and
some cars were still driving.

Okay. So he starts running southbound on El Camino. Does he ever cross
back over the median at all that you remember?

I don’t remember. I mean, it wasn’t...

Okay.

I don’t believe it was, like, a direct shot. I just...

Okay. So then...

I remember going that direction and kinda, like, trying to corral him and

trying to - there were a lot of people out at this point and - I don’t n- I mean,

Okay.
Uh...

So then you said that he - he took off after the second Tase, and then you saw
- you guys kind of followed him. Were you walkin’ along with him?

Yeah, I was kinda jogging after him.

Okay.

Yeah.

Um, and you said that you saw Deputy Wang pull out his baton after that?
Yes.

Okay. And did you see him try to strike, or did anything happen at that point?

Yeah, I saw him swinging it. I don’t know if it made contact, where it did, or
when.

Okay.

Um, but I do remember him yelling like, “Stop.”

Okay.

And m- I - he was - he sounded scared.

Okay.

And I saw him - I saw the gentleman swing at him, and I didn’t know if he hit
him or not or what, and then that’s when the other deputy a- at some point,

came in, tackled him (unintelligible).

Okay. So you saw the suspect try to hit Deputy Wang, but you’re not sure if

I don’t remember.

Okay. Okay. So suspect - you said that, um, from the corner of your eye you
saw another deputy and then, um, after the suspect tried to take a swing at
Deputy Wang, you saw somebody come and tackle the suspect?

Mm-hm.

Okay. So the s- and then you helped along with that. So the suspect is down
on the ground at that point?

Yes.

Okay. And is he on his stomach, or is he on his back?

I don’t really remember.

Okay. And then was he controlled at that point or...

No, he was still kicking and fighting, and we didn’t have control of his hands.
I do remember I, um, thinking, um, if I can punch him in, like, a soft spot
maybe he’lI jolt his arm out.

Mm-hm

Um, so I was, like, on his lower half. I know that much. I don’t remember
exactly where I hit. It wasn’t effective, it wasn’t - I just - I wasn’t trying to
hurt him.

Right.

I was trying to get him in a soft spot where he would, like, let go.

Mm-hm

And then that didn’t work so I was like, “Well, that’s not gonna work,” so I
just kinda held my position and then - then short - at s- some point then the
pepper spray came.

Okay. So was he at - when he was down on the ground and you guys are
struggling to get arms out, right? You’re basically trying to handcuff him at

that point.

I don’t remember.
Okay. And was anybody giving him any type of commands at that point?

Yeah, there was a lot of - a lot of - [heard a lot of yelling, a lot of, like - like,
can’t remember exactly what was said and I don’t wanna try and...

Sure.

But I do remember a lot of voices.

Okay. And then...

A lot of things were happening.

Okay.

I do - the one thing I do remember the most was, like, my sergeant going on
the air, asking for, “Code 3, fire,” um, to, like, or medics or something, like,
“Code 3 Medics, just get ready to come in.”

Okay. And do you...

That was before we had him under control.

Okay. So he - he wasn’t handcuffed at that point when they - they were
already calling for the medics?

Yeah, not from what I remember.

Okay. So he’s down on the ground, and how long do you think it took to - to
get him under control? How long were you guys struggling with him?

I don’t know. It felt like forever ‘cause I had the pepper spray in my eyes and

I - it was hurting, and I couldn’t see, and I just think - remember thinking,
like, I - “More people need to get here,” like, “I can’t stay on him too much

Um, did you see any other type of uses of force, uh, during the incident? You
said that you tried to throw a punch to get him to put his arms out.

Yeah, I...

Um, other than those incidents, do you remember any other type of force
being used or did you see...

No, I just remember trying to get control of his hands.

Okay.

Like, we were - all of us were trying to get con- he was just out- I mean, he

Okay. So when he did get handcuffed, you were still - you were still there,
though? No one had relieved you at that point?

Right.
And you still had the - the effects of the pepper spray?
Yes, sir.

Okay. And then, what position was he at if you - if you knew after he got
handcuffed?

I d- I didn’t know.

Okay. So after he’s handcuffed, when did you get relieved? How long did it
take?

Um, I still never r- really got relieved. Someone handed me a bottle of water.
Mm-hm.

And I put it on my face and then, um, I remember us, mm, rolling him onto
his side. I don’t remember from what position.

Okay.

Um, and then eventually sitting him up.

Okay. So he was sitting up at some point and at that point you think the
handcuffs were on him?

Oh, yeah.

Behind his back?

He was already - by the time we rolled him onto his side, his - the handcuffs
were on.

The handcuffs were on him?
(Unintelligible).

And they were on him behind his back?

Yes.

Okay. And then were the medics or fire there at that point, or not yet?

Um, they were on their way. I could see ‘em coming down and I heard, uh, it
was kinda a lot of chaos and commotion but, uh, you know, sergeant or

someone saying, “It’s Code 4 for fire,” like, “Get ‘em in here.”

Okay. And then did you actually - were you still there when fire came on-
scene?

Yes.
Okay. And then what did you see them do?

Um, they took - checked his pulse, uh, a couple of them tended to Deputy
Wang.

Mm-hm.

Um, I was - at that point I moved to his - his back, he was leaning up on my
knee and, uh, they were just, like, getting ready, um, they’re ch- they were
checking his pulse. They’re like, “He has a pulse, he has...” He responded at
one point.

Mm-hm.

And then stopped responding to pain stimulus while they were trying to do it,
I think, and then...

Okay.

They were like, “Well, let’s get him on his back and start CPR,” so then I, you
know, helped ‘em bring him to his back.

Okay.

And then they started CPR. Then I was - I was...
Okay.

..done with that.

I don’t remember.
Okay. And were his handcuffs off at that point?
No, they were still on.

Okay. So talk a little bit about, um, what you were feeling personally and why
you did what you did as far as your use of force, and what you thought was
gonna work or - or what - what wasn’t gonna work just because of the
situation.

Yeah. Um, you know, m- first got there, like I said, it was, “Code 3 cover,”
call, so I was - did - not really sure what happened, but I knew it wasn’t, um,
he called for Code 3 cover for a reason.

Mm-hm.

And I saw him, I didn’t, you know...try to get him to stop. Um, the look in his
eyes, um, was s- similar to the look I’ve seen in people who’ve been under the
influence of dissociative anesthetics. Um, and I, you know, it - he had been
running so I was like, “I don’t - the - I don’t need him,” like, just - he looked
like he was, like, when he was walking towards me he was gonna, like, just
walk right through me and just...

Right.

...barrel me over, so that’s when I went to the side. And then once the fight
was on it was, uh, nothing was working. Like, nothing, and we were just -
someone was calling for m- more Code 3 cover and I just remember, like, th- I
just - I didn’t know what was gonna work. I was just trying - I knew he
needed to be brought to the ground. That was gonna be our best chance and
no- nothing was working to get him to the ground.

Right.

And then even when we got him to the ground, he was still fighting pretty
good and, uh, I don’t know - I don’t know, I just remember, like, thinking
someone was gonna get seriously hurt. Like, it was getting to that point.

Okay.

And he was - like I said, when I f- when I first saw him, he was - he’s a big
guy, and I’m not so big.

Mm-hm.

So I was like, “If I take one punch from him, I’m - I’m out. I’m - I’m done,”
and same li- I mean, Deputy Wang is not a very big guy, either.

Right.

And I know he was fixated on him, so...

Okay. So it’s safe to say that you feared for your safety?
Yeah.

Okay.

And then there were more people around and he was running, and we’re
trying to make sure - I mean, he just - at - once it was on it was, like, he was -
once it was really on, he really wasn’t stopping.

Okay.
And I didn’t know who was gonna get caught in his...
Okay.

..his whatever. His mindset. I didn’t know who was gonna get caught in his -
his path.

So you said earlier that he had, uh, he had tried to throw a punch at Deputy
Wang. Did you see him try to do anything else to Deputy Wang? Did he, um,
did they, um, did he take him down to the ground, or did you see any point
where he actually struck any officers or attacked any other officers during this
whole time?

I mean, the whole time I know he - he kept trying to gr- I - I have, like, when
he was on a - when he popped up at one point, felt like he was lurching at my
legs and, uh, when I saw the video it looked like he tried to grab, uh, Deputy
DeMartini. Um, like, I just remember the whole situation, like, his arms being
everywhere and just grabbing and swinging, and that’s pretty much what I
remember in the moment.

Okay.

Just, like, what I was feeling, like, he was just grabbing and swinging, and I
didn’t want him to grab anything off my belt, or any - I mean, I was m- I

didn’t pull my ASP out because I knew if he got a hold of it, he would take it
right outta my hands, and it wouldn’t...

Right.
It wasn’t good...

Okay. Um, at any time, did you see any type of weapons or anything in the
suspect’s hands?

No.

Okay. So you initially said that you had seen some bags in his hands. Do you -
do you have any idea what those were, or what he was carrying?

I don’t.

Okay.

I don’t even I- I mean, I d- seriously just pulled them off him so that they
wouldn’t be used as a weapon, or he couldn’t get into ‘em if there was a
weapon or not. I didn’t know ‘cause they were closed.

Right.

And then once they were off him, that was the end of - of those. I didn’t see
“em again.

Okay. And do you recognize the - the suspect when you first saw him?
Have you had any prior type contacts with him?
No.

Yeah.

of crisis intervention could’ve worked?

No.

Okay. And why not?

Um, everything happened very fast, and from the moment that I got on-scene,
he wasn’t listening to anything that we s- said.

Okay.

And he was, uh, becoming more and more of a risk as it went on to the public
and to us.

Okay. So at any point, um, did you, uh, I know you - that you said he had a
look in his eyes, and that when he was talking he wasn’t - he mainly wasn’t

Yeah.

And do the best to enjoy it. So...
Yeah.

Okay. Okay. We’re almost there.
All right.

So just a couple questions more. Um, we just wanna talk a little bit more
about the - the initial contact.

Mm-hm.

So you leave headquarters and there’s at least two other deputies leavin’ at the
same time.

Mm-hm.

Um, when you get on-scene, I’m assuming all three of you got on-scene at the
same time, or close to the same time?

I think so, yeah.

And do you know if you guys all took the same routes or - or not? I mean, was
there, like, someone directly in front of you?

I - I wa- I was the front car. I remember looking back at one point and seeing
lights behind me.

Okay.

Um, I don’t know how many people were t...

Okay.

If they took the - I know at one point, I think when we were on - after we
made that right from Magnolia, before we got onto El Camino, I looked back
and I saw lights behind me.

Okay.

Okay. So then you make, uh, so you get outta the car, and you’re not exactly
sure where Wang is at that point?

I knew his car was farther - ‘cause when I r- came on-scene, I saw his car
making that U-turn.

Okay. So he was making a turn.

But I knew he was north of me.

Okay.

I just didn’t know how far away he was.

Okay. And then what about the deputies that came with you, uh, when you left
headquarters? Do you have any idea where their location was?

I f- figured they probably got there when I did. Like, when I’ve - I was, like,
I’m pretty sure they’re with me. I wasn’t...

Okay.

..certain.

Well, when you got outta the car, n- you were by yourself, pretty much?
Uh, y- I mean, I didn’t s- remember s...

You didn’t see anybody else with you? You didn’t walk up with anybody?
Yeah.

Okay.

Not that I...

And so then when you got out of the car, wh- where did you first see the
suspect?

I saw him on - once I got outta the car, he was already under the - on the

And that’s where I was, and he was walking towards me at that point.

Okay. And then - and you knew that that’s what the - the cover call was
about? How - or how did you know that?

Uh, the blue shirt, and he - he’s the one that I saw running in traffic...
Okay.

..as Deputy Wang was turning around.

Okay. So then you confront him and you said he’s maybe 25 yards away?
When I first saw him.

When you first saw him.

Well - well, I mean, I saw him, but when I first saw him on the sidewalk when
I got outta the car, he was probably, like, 25 yards away.

Okay. And then he starts walkin’ towards you?
Mm-hm.
Okay. And what, again, were your verbal commands at that point?

Um, what I remember saying was, “Stop.” Um, I don’t remember how many
times. I know it was multiple times.

Mm-hm.
Um, I said, “Stop,” something to the effect of that or, you know...
Right.

Um, I remember, uh, and then I remember him saying, “I didn’t do anything,”
then I said, “Hey, let’s put your stuff down.”

Okay.
Um, something to that effect, ‘cause I’ve had it before where someone has had
bags and they’ve swung and they’ ve hit people that I’ve been working with,

and they’ve gotten hurt from that.

Okay. And why?

Uh, because of the Code 3 cover call, um, the fact that he wasn’t listening, the
look that he had in his eyes, uh, the fact that he kept walking towards me. Uh,

I didn’t really know the specifics of what happened...

Mm-hm.

...when Deputy Wang first contacted him. Like I said, all I knew was it’s Code
3 cover and he was - there was a male running in lanes, which is not a normal

thing to do.

Okay.

So I just wanted to get him in handcuffs and get the situation controlled...

Okay.

..Tight then and there and figure out why he was acting the way he was acting
and figure out, like, what had happened and what was going on.

Okay. So basically, based on what you just articulated, uh, you’re j- you’re
gonna try to detain him and - and the way that you were gonna try to detain
him was first by placing him in handcuffs?

Well, first, I wanted to talk to him.

Right.

But when he s- wasn’t responding to my commands and my direction, then I
was, like, he - I would like to detain him in handcuffs...

Okay.

..for our safety and his safety and everything...
Okay.

..everyone else around.

And after that initial confrontation, how long did it take for you to recognize
or see, uh, your backup?

Uh, pretty much as soon as he pulled away I saw, like, more deputies around
me.

Okay.
Uh, mm-hm.

Okay. So you, uh, you tried to grab his arm at first, you pulled away, and at
that point, did you stop?

No, I continued to try to get control of him.

Okay. And he kept pulling away at that point?

Yeah.

Okay. So at one point you said that you, uh, during the incident - it was a little
bit later on in the incident that you had deployed, uh, you had taken out your
Taser.

Yeah, I took it out a couple times.

Okay.

I don’t remember the order or when or what.

Okay. Uh, but you never y- deployed your Taser at all?

Correct.

Okay.

I turned it on, uh, pointed it at him.

Uh-huh.

I never - I didn’t have a good - a good shot on him so I put it away.

Okay. And then so you, um, took out your Taser a couple times, uh, and then,
uh, did you take out your ASP at any time during the incident?

No.

Sure. Okay. And then after that, after you got hit with the pepper spray, then
that’s wh- you don’t really remember too much after that?

Yeah, just what I was hearing and just kinda what I was thinking was, like -
like, “Holy - holy crap, I can’t - I can’t see.”

Okay. And was...

“T don’t know where his hands are, I don’t know if anyone has his hands, I
don’t want him - grab me or anything on my belt.”

Okay.

So I just hunkered down.

Okay.

And then had my handcuffs in my left hand and was, like, they’re li- so like,
“Handcuff him,” I’m like, “I can’t see - I can’t see,” so, like, someone

grabbed him and...

Okay. And was anybody taking charge at that point as far as, um, one of the
deputies or the sergeant as far as, like, giving commands or - or kind of, like...

Um, it seemed like Sergeant Weidner was more of the one that was, like,
taking charge, but I don’t remember everything that he was saying. The main
thing, I remember the medics.

Okay.

Call for medics.

And was he talkin’ to you guys or was he talkin’ to the suspect? Or do you
remember?

I remember him, uh, like, telling me just to, like - like, I had - ‘cause I had
pepper spray in my eyes.

Mm-hm.

Um, “I can’t see.” He’s like, “Just - just stay in it - just stay in it,” and ’m
like, “M- I’m here, I’m staying, and...”

SUPPLEMENT 8 - Deputy Wang's Uniform and Equipment 18-1003-02
Collection and Chain of Custod)

Investigation:
During the evening hours of October 9, 2018, I met with San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Sergeant

Szaboles Szerenyi at the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, Millbrae Substation. Sergeant Szerenyi
opened Deputy Joshua Wang’s secure locker (with Deputy Wang’s permission) and turned over the
following items to me:
1 Black basket weave duty belt with the following items:

1 empty magazine holder (for two magazines)

1 empty taser holster

1 empty collapsible baton holster

1 portable radio holder

1 portable radio (Motorola APX 7000, #12359199)

2 handcuff cases with 2 pairs of handcuffs inside

1 firearm holster

1 Glock Model 17 9mm Handgun (Serial #BFKS476) with Surefire X300 Ultra Light

1 pepper spray holder (with pepper spray canister inside)

1 empty tourniquet holder

4 belt keepers
1 Pelican 7060 LED Flashlight (#1100/ PD#4359)

1 inner ballistic vest with earpiece attached
1 long sleeve uniform shirt (had been dry-cleaned)
3 Glock 9mm magazines with 52 loose 9mm rounds

([ took a total of 10 digital photographs of the collected items. SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-
1003-02, Evidence Item #3.)

(It should be noted that the Glock 17 firearm had been rendered safe at the scene by San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office Sergeant Jacob Trickett. The firearm and 3 magazines had been unloaded by the San
Mateo County Crime Laboratory during the evening hours of October 3, 2018. The SMCO Crime Lab
also took detailed photos of the above mentioned items on the evening of the incident and while the
items were at the scene.)

I personally transported all of the listed items (using gloves) to the San Mateo County District
Attorney’s Office where they were locked in a secure storage area. On October 10, 2018, I removed all
of the items from the secure storage area and I packaged the Glock 17 firearm, 3 magazines and the duty
belt with all attachments for transportation to the San Mateo County Crime Laboratory. I re-secured all
of the above items in secure storage on October 10, 2018 and then removed them again on the morning
of October 11, 2018. Inspector Jamie Draper personally transported the Glock 17 firearm, along with
Deputy Wang’s duty belt and attachments to the San Mateo County Crime Laboratory for analysis on
October 11, 2018 at approximately 0930 hours. (SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02,

On October 8, 2018, I spoke with San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Szaboles Szerenyi
regarding the chain of custody of Deputy Wang’s uniform and equipment. The following is a summary
of my conversation with Sergeant Szerenyi:

Sergeant Szerenyi stated that Sergeant Jacob Trickett returned to the Millbrae Police Substation on
October 3, 2018 during the late evening hours (after the crime scene had been completely cleared).
Sergeant Trickett provided Sergeant Szerenyi with Deputy Joshua Wang’s duty belt, which contained
the duty weapon in the holster. Sergeant Szerenyi stated that Sergeant Trickett also provided him with
Deputy Wang’s uniform shirt, ballistic vest, badge, flashlight, magazines and ammunition that had been
emptied into a plastic bag and miscellaneous note pads and flash cards. Sergeant Szerenyi had been
informed by Sergeant Trickett that the San Mateo County Crime Lab no longer needed the items for
evidence. Sergeant Szerenyi received Deputy Wang’s permission to open his secure locker in the
Millbrae Police Substation men’s locker room. Sergeant Szerenyi stated that he placed all of the above
listed items into Deputy Wang’s locker and then he re-secured the locker. The only exception was
Deputy Wang’s uniform shirt, which Sergeant Szerenyi placed into a basket to have dry-cleaned for
Deputy Wang for his return to work. Sergeant Szerenyi stated that he did not wear gloves when
handling any of Deputy Wang’s equipment items due to the fact that the San Mateo County Crime Lab

had photographed all of the equipment and had released it to Sergeant Trickett.

On October 10, 2018, I spoke with San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Jacob Trickett regarding
the chain of custody of Deputy Wang’s uniform and equipment. The following is a summary of my
conversation with Sergeant Trickett:

Sergeant Trickett stated that he arrived at the scene of the incident in Millbrae on October 3, 2018.
Sergeant Trickett arrived and noticed that Deputy Joshua Wang had a facial injury and he made sure that
Deputy Wang received medical attention from EMS personnel on scene. Prior to EMS personnel
transporting Deputy Wang to the hospital, they informed Sergeant Trickett that they needed to turn over
Deputy Wang’s firearm and duty belt to someone. Sergeant Trickett took possession of Deputy Wang’s
duty belt, which contained his duty weapon, as well as Deputy Wang’s uniform shirt and inner ballistic
vest.

Sergeant Trickett made Deputy Wang’s Glock firearm safe by removing the magazine and clearing the
unspent cartridge from the chamber. Sergeant Trickett was not wearing gloves at that time. Sergeant
Trickett secured all of Deputy Wang’s uniform and equipment items in the rear cargo locker of Patrol
Vehicle #503, his assigned patrol vehicle. Sergeant Trickett locked and secured his vehicle and he
stated that no other personnel had access to his locked patrol vehicle.

Later during the evening time on October 3, 2018, Sergeant Trickett opened the rear of his patrol vehicle
and allowed members of the San Mateo County Crime Laboratory and an Inspector with the San Mateo
County District Attorney’s Office, Bureau of Investigations to examine and photograph Deputy Wang’s
uniform and equipment. (I personally observed Crime Lab Criminalists Anthony Delmonico and Cindy
Anzalone, as well as DA Inspector Greg Giguiere wearing gloves when they were taking photos and
examining Deputy Wang’s uniform and equipment.)

Sergeant Trickett was provided with Deputy Wang’s uniform shirt, ballistic vest and duty belt back once
the San Mateo County Crime Lab was done examining and photographing the items. The San Mateo
County Crime Lab Criminalists informed Sergeant Trickett that they were done examining and
photographing the uniform and equipment and that the items would not be collected as evidence.
Sergeant Trickett transported the items to the Millbrae Substation and provided them personally to San
Mateo County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Szaboles Szerenyi. Sergeant Trickett stated that he was not
wearing gloves when he first handled Deputy Wang’s uniform and equipment and he was not wearing
gloves when he tumed over the items to Sergeant Szerenyi.

On October 11, 2018, I released Deputy Wang’s long sleeve uniform shirt, his inner ballistic vest with
attached earpiece and the 52 loose (9mm) rounds from Deputy Wang’s Glock firearm and magazines to
San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Professional Standards Sergeant Jon Sebring.

SUPPLEMENT 9 - Interview of Sergeant Dave Weidner

Investigation:
On October 3, 2018 I was assigned as the primary investigator for the San Mateo County District

Attorney’s Office investigation into an Officer Involved Critical Incident (OICT) involving deputies from
the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

On October 4, 2018 I conducted an interview with Sergeant Dave Weidner of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office. Sergeant Weidner was one of five (5) deputies involved in a use of force incident which
included the deployment of a Taser and the use of pepper spray. The subject of the use of force,
deceased subject Chinedu Okobi was later pronounced deceased at Mills-Peninsula Hospital. This
incident occurred in the 1400 block of El Camino Real in the City of Millbrae. The interview with
Sergeant Weidner was conducted at the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office and was
documented through both audio and video recording. Also present during the interview was attorney
Sarah Burdick from Rains Lucia Stern, PC. During the interview, I confirmed with Sergeant Weidner
that he was providing a voluntary statement to the District Attommey’s Office and that he had not been
ordered to provide a statement by any members of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. Prior to the
beginning of the interview, I met with Sarah Burdick who advised me that Sergeant Weidner wanted to
provide an initial statement based upon his own memories and perceptions of the events of the incident
without reviewing any Mobile Audio Video (MAV) footage or civilian video footage. Based upon this
request, Sergeant Weidner did not view any video footage of the incident until after the completion of
our interview.

Interview with Sergeant Dave Weidner (paraphrased and not verbatim):
Sergeant Weidner stated he has worked for the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office for approximately 18

years. Sergeant Weidner began his career at the Sheriff's Office as a Correctional Officer and served in
that capacity for approximately one and a half (1.5) years before being promoted to the position of
Deputy Sheriff. Prior to starting his employment with the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, Sergeant
Weidner said he worked as a reserve police officer with the South San Francisco Police Department and
was also a contractor working building security with the United States Department of State. Sergeant
Weidner advised me that he is currently a sergeant assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau and was
promoted to sergeant approximately two (2) years ago. Sergeant Weidner told me he had spent
approximately ten (10) years of his career at the Sheriff's Office assigned to working uniformed patrol.
Sergeant Weidner said he was assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau as a patrol deputy for
approximately three (3) years before being promoted to Sergeant and had recently been assigned back to
the Millbrae Patrol Bureau as a sergeant in March of 2018.

Sergeant Weidner said October 3, 2018 was a normal scheduled shift and that he is currently assigned to
day shift, working a twelve (12) hour shift from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day. Sergeant Weidner
explained he works a rotating schedule and does not have fixed days off. Sergeant Weidner explained
his shift on October 3, 2018 had either been his seventh (7) or eight (8*) straight day of working.
Sergeant Weidner explained to me that the Sheriffs Office is currently short-staffed which has resulted
in the need for a great deal of overtime to be worked to fill the void in staffing. Sergeant Weidner

informed me that October 3, 2018 was the first day of his regularly scheduled work week and he had
worked a 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM overtime shift in the Transportation Unit on October 2, 2018.

Sergeant Weidner stated he arrived at work on October 3, 2018 at approximately 4:45 AM to relieve the
night shift sergeant. Sergeant Weidner explained to me that the Sheriff’s Office assigns one sergeant per
shift to each of the three patrol bureaus on the bayside of the peninsula (Millbrae, San Carlos and
Redwood City) so he was the only sergeant working the Millbrae Patrol Bureau during his shift hours on
October 3, 2018. Sergeant Weidner further explained the coverage area for the Millbrae Patrol Bureau
includes all unincorporated areas on the bayside of San Mateo County from Highway 92 in San Mateo,
north to the county limits at the San Francisco border as well as the entire City of Millbrae. As the patrol
sergeant working out of the Millbrae Patrol Bureau, Sergeant Weidner explained his area of
responsibility on his shift is the entire North County area he described previously. Sergeant Weidner told
me there is no Lieutenant assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau, as such his direct supervisor for his
shift was Captain Paul Kunkel, who is the commander in-charge of the Millbrae Patrol Bureau.

Sergeant Weidner stated he was wearing a standard wool uniform which he described as fully
identifiable as a police uniform with Sheriff's Office patches on the shoulders and his “chevrons”
identifying him as a sergeant on the sleeves. Sergeant Weidner stated he was wearing an outer ballistic
vest carrier outside of his uniform. Sergeant Weidner described the items he carried on his outer vest
carrier as an ASP (collapsible baton), pepper spray, a police radio and a utility pouch containing a back-
up firearm. Sergeant Weidner described the items he carried on his duty belt as his duty firearm on his
right hip, a Taser on his left hip, as well as a tourniquet and key ring on the front area of his belt.

Sergeant Weidner said he was driving a Ford Explorer Sheriff's Office vehicle which was fully outfitted
with Sheriff’s Office markings, a light bar and operational Mobile Audio Video (MAV) equipment.
Sergeant Weidner stated the MAV equipment also included a portable microphone, which he was
wearing clipped on his vest. He believed the MAV would have captured all the audio occurring at the
time of the incident and in the aftermath of the incident. Sergeant Weidner described the procedure for
utilizing the MAV equipment to me and explained that at the beginning of the shift, the portable
microphone would be removed from a charger inside the vehicle, activated and placed on either the
uniform or outer vest carrier. Sergeant Weidner explained that upon activating the front facing
emergency light bar equipment, the MAV will turn on and the portable recorder will activate which will
both then begin recording. Sergeant Weidner stated all the equipment in his vehicle was properly
functioning at the time of the incident as was all of his equipment on his person.

I asked Sergeant Weidner if he received a full night’s sleep prior to beginning his shift on October 3,
2018. Sergeant Weidner said he typically goes to sleep at 8:15 PM as he has to wake up by 3:20 AM to
get to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau by 5:00 AM. Sergeant Weidner confirmed he followed this same
sleeping pattern the night before the patrol shift in question. Sergeant Weidner stated he felt both “fine”
and “normal” at the beginning of his shift and was not feeling either under the weather or sick. Sergeant

SUPPLEMENT 9 - Interview of Sergeant Dave Weidner

Weidner described his off hours after his shift on October 2, 2018 as uneventful and described his
evening as spending time with his wife, smoking a cigar and preparing food for the next day. Sergeant
Weidner said he did not consume any alcohol the evening before his shift.

Sergeant Weidner discussed his activity earlier in his shift on October 3, 2018. Sergeant Weidner
described three (3) calls he responded to earlier in the shift, all of which also involved Deputy Bryan
Watt. Sergeant Weidner described the first call as a call for service in which they were dispatched to a
transient female walking down the street who appeared to need assistance. Sergeant Weidner initially
described the female as “combative” with the other deputies; however as I questioned him further he
described her as being “argumentative” and attempting to “pull away” from the deputies as they
attempted to detain her and attempt to provide her assistance. Sergeant Weidner said the subject was
detained in handcuffs, for both her safety and the safety of the deputies, but was ultimately released at
the scene. Sergeant Weidner described the second call as a self-initiated contact by Deputy Watt in
which he contacted a transient subject on the platform at the Millbrae BART station. Sergeant Weidner
said the transient subject began to assault Deputy Watt and Deputy Watt had to call for “code-3 cover”
which resulted in Sergeant Weidner responding to the scene. Sergeant Weidner said the subject was
subdued by responding officers and was found to have outstanding warrants out of multiple
jurisdictions. Sergeant Weidner said the subject was already down on the ground and detained in
handcuffs by the time he arrived on the platform so he was not involved in the physical act of detaining
the subject. Sergeant Weidner described the third call as him having to respond to a traffic enforcement
stop conducted by Deputy Watt in which the driver of the vehicle was refusing to sign a citation.
Sergeant Weidner said he responded and was able to convince the subject to sign the citation without
incident.

I asked Sergeant Weidner to walk me through the incident which occurred in the 1400 block of El
Camino Real on October 3, 2018. I asked Sergeant Weidner to start with the point he first became aware
of the radio traffic up to the point he was relieved at the scene. Sergeant Weidner told me he was in his
office at the Millbrae Police Substation doing administrative work when he heard Deputy Josh Wang
broadcast over the radio that he either was attempting to make a pedestrian stop or would “be out” with
somebody. Sergeant Weidner then recalled Deputy Wang stating over the radio the subject had run from
him and was now running in traffic. Sergeant Weidner said he started to respond from the station with
Deputies Alyssa Lorenzatti, Bryan Watt and John DeMartini who had all been at the station finishing
their lunch. Sergeant Weidner explained that as he was getting up out of his chair to begin heading
toward his patrol vehicle, he heard Deputy Wang broadcast a request for “code 3 cover” over the radio.
Sergeant Weidner recalled hearing an additional broadcast, regarding the subject running in and out of
traffic, while he and the other units were on their way to the location.

Sergeant Weidner said upon arrival on scene, he drove his vehicle north in the southbound lanes of
traffic with the intent to position his vehicle in a manner which would allow his MAV camera the best
angle to capture the incident on video. Sergeant Weidner said his vision of what was occurring was

SUPPLEMENT 9 - Interview of Sergeant Dave Weidner

initially obscured by a light pole; however he could see a subject he identified as a black male adult
whom deputies were attempting to contact. Upon first seeing the subject, Sergeant Weidner said he
observed the subject to be holding his hands straight up in the air while Deputy Wang approach the
subject from behind. Sergeant Weidner said he thought Deputy Wang would be able to grab the
subject’s arm and place him into handcuffs and thought the subject would be compliant based upon the
fact the subject was holding his hands up. Sergeant Weidner said he then saw the subject pull his arms
down, turn and possibly push Deputy Wang.

Sergeant Weidner said he saw Deputy Wang draw and deploy is Taser at the subject. Sergeant Weidner
explained that he could see Deputy Wang had gotten an effective Taser deployment and saw the subject
stagger and fall over backwards. Sergeant Weidner added that he is a Taser instructor for the Sheriff’s
Office and he was focusing on both the subject and on Deputy Wang’s trigger finger to make sure he
was not continuing to press down on the trigger. He knew that continuing to depress the trigger would
cause the Taser to continue to be active. Sergeant Weidner said he noted the location of the two (2)
Taser probes in the subject’s body and indicated one probe was in the subject’s right forearm and the
second was in the subject’s torso on the right side of the subject’s body.

Sergeant Weidner said once the subject fell to the ground on his back, he was able to see the subject
appeared to be under the influence of a controlled substance. Sergeant Weidner based this observation
on the fact the subject was staring straight into the sky and was “talking to God”. Sergeant Weidner said
he had personally experienced being “tased” as part of his instructor training and based upon that
experience, he knows the only physical reaction possible is either screaming or being totally quiet while
the device is actively deploying a shock. Sergeant Weidner said in his experience, he believed the
subject would have had to be under the influence of either PCP or “bath salts” to be able to talk through
the pain of the Taser deployment. Sergeant Weidner said he moved to grab the subject’s arm at the
culmination of the five (5) second long deployment to tried and roll the subject over, but the subject
pulled away from him. Sergeant Weidner stated, “He pulled away like I wasn’t even there” and said the
subject pulled him off balance, which forced him to let go of the subject because he feared falling onto
the Taser wires and getting hit with the next activation of the Taser.

Sergeant Weidner said the subject then “leapt up” and that as soon he was up, Deputy Wang activated
the Taser for a second five (5) second long deployment. Sergeant Weidner said this caused the subject to
fall back to the ground again where he and the other deputies again tried to grab the subject and detain
him; however the subject continued to pull away from them because “he was way too strong”. Sergeant
Weidner said he noted at this point in the incident that one of the Taser wires had broken, which he
knew would render the Taser ineffective. Sergeant Weidner said the subject then got back up a second
time and started to run diagonally across the roadway into the northbound lanes of traffic. Sergeant
Weidner identified Deputies Josh Wang, Bryan Watt, Alyssa Lorenzatti and John DeMartini as all being
present by this point in the incident and all following the subject across the roadway to try and get him
into custody. Sergeant Weidner said the subject was yelling something “incoherent” and “something

about God”.

Sergeant Weidner said he saw Deputy Wang deploy his ASP, but was unsure if Deputy Wang was able
to make contact with the subject when he swung the ASP at him. Sergeant Weidner said he knew that
Deputy Wang had been struck by the subject because he saw Deputy Wang’s ASP and Taser “literally
fly through the air”. Sergeant Weidner said he and the other deputies managed to surround the subject as
the he saw the subject lowered his center of gravity and “basically linebacker tackle Josh” (Deputy
Wang). Sergeant Weidner saw the subject use both hands to grab toward Deputy Wang’s legs in an
attempt to pull Deputy Wang toward him and pull him off balance in an effort to “take Josh to his back”.
Sergeant Weidner said he noted at this point that the subject had grabbed a hold of Deputy Wang’s
firearm and was worried they were going to get into an Officer Involved Shooting. Sergeant Weidner
told me “we had literally escalated through our entire use of force” and noted the use of and failure of
verbal commands, Taser deployment, the baton, and pepper spray; however Sergeant Weidner did then
correct himself and properly noted that pepper spray had not yet been deployed in the incident.

Sergeant Weidner noted that the subject then went to the ground; however he was unsure how the
subject went down. Sergeant Weidner speculated that the subject may have tripped but stated he was
unsure. Sergeant Weidner said once the subject was on the ground, he instructed the other deputies to
“get on top of him” with the thought that they would be able to control the subject and try and get more
deputies on scene to assist them. Sergeant Weidner indicated he again asked for “code 3 cover” to get
additional deputies to the scene. Sergeant Weidner told me that Deputy DeMartini was positioned at the
subject’s feet, Deputy Lorenzatti was at the subject’s legs and he was trying to gain control of the
subject’s right arm, which he noted still had the Taser probe embedded in it. Sergeant Weidner said the
subject was bleeding “pretty profusely” from the area of the probe which caused Sergeant Weidner’s
hands to keep slipping off of the subject.

Sergeant Weidner said he was later told it was Deputy Wang who deployed the pepper spray at that point
in the struggle; however he did not see him do it. Sergeant Weidner speculated the pepper spray was
possibly directed upward at the subject’s face while he was in a somewhat prone position on the ground
which cause the spray to miss the subject completely and instead strike Deputy Watt, Deputy Lorenzatti
and Sergeant Weidner. Sergeant Weidner said Deputy Watt took a direct “shot to the face” and Deputy
Lorenzatti took a direct hit. Sergeant Weidner added that he received the splash back in his face from the
pepper spray as well. Sergeant Weidner said Deputy Watt was completely incapacitated from the effects
of the pepper spray and Sergeant Weidner said he knew there was no way Deputy Watt could continue to
assist them because he noted Deputy Watt could not breathe and had to “back off’. Sergeant Weidner
recalled Deputy Lorenzatti also having similar difficulty and believed she said something to the effect
of, “Sarge, I can’t breathe” and “I can’t see, Sarge”. Sergeant Weidner said he responded by telling
Deputy Lorenzatti to “hang in there” and to “stay in the fight”.

Sergeant Weidner said he was able to get the subject’s arm out from under him and yelled out that he

needed handcuffs at which point someone placed one pair of handcuffs on one of the subject’s wrists.
Sergeant Weidner yelled out for a second pair of handcuffs (to link together) because he knew (based on
the subject’s large size) “there was no way we were getting his hands behind his back with one pair”.
Sergeant Weidner said someone was ultimately able to place a second set of handcuffs on the subject but
he could not see who it was, but believed it was Deputy Wang who was able to get the subject’s other
arm behind the subject’s back when they were finally able to get the subject handcuffed.

Sergeant Weidner said once the subject was successfully handcuffed, he immediately became concerned
about the risk for positional asphyxia since they had physically been on top of the subject. Sergeant
Weidner directed the other deputies to get off the subject and assist him in getting the subject into a
sitting position. Sergeant Weidner estimated he had the subject sitting up within approximately ten (10)
seconds of being handcuffed. Sergeant Weidner said he checked for and located a pulse on the subject
once he was in a seated position and noted the subject was initially “not responsive but all the sudden he
woke up” and was actively looking around. Sergeant Weidner said he then had the Fire Department and
medical personnel, who had been staging nearby, come into the scene. Sergeant Weidner explained that
he had three (3) deputies who had been hurt. He wanted to start following protocol and setting up a
crime scene so he requested Captain Paul Kunkel respond and assist in controlling the scene.

Sergeant Weidner said he believed it was at this point that he began directing the deputies on the scene
to start obtaining witness statements and noted that Deputy Josh Wang was bleeding “pretty profusely
from the face”. Sergeant Weidner added that he wanted to get medical treatment for Deputy Wang right
away because he did not know the severity of Deputy Wang’s injuries. Sergeant Weidner reported that a
Millbrae “city worker” was on the scene helping Deputy Watt flush his eyes out with water so he began
attending to Deputy Lorenzatti while also trying to monitor the now detained subject. Sergeant Weidner
recalled that he was focused on trying to get the crime scene set up and get the subject medical attention
right away. Sergeant Weidner recalled seeing the paramedics tending to the subject, and the subject
being alert and looking around, and “then all the sudden he just coded”. Sergeant Weidner recalled one
paramedic yelling to the Fire Captain, that he needed to get a heart monitor on the subject, but saw the
Captain did not hear the request so Sergeant Weidner went to the Captain and passed on the request.
Sergeant Weidner said it was at this point that all the medical personnel on scene then began working
(treatment) on the subject and he began activating the Officer Involved Critical Incident Protocol.

I asked Sergeant Weidner if he ever heard Deputy Wang put out a description of the subject he was
attempting to contact, but Sergeant Weidner said he did not recall a description of the subject ever being
broadcast on the radio. I asked Sergeant Weidner how he knew the person they attempted to detain was
the subject Deputy Wang was trying to contact. Sergeant Weidner explained to me that when he arrived
on scene, he saw Deputy Wang pulling up behind the subject and that the subject with his hands up was
the only person he saw on the sidewalk between him and Deputy Wang. Sergeant Weidner also cited the
fact the subject had his hands held up and the lack of other persons around as how he deduced it was the
right subject.

SUPPLEMENT 9 - Interview of Sergeant Dave Weidner

I asked Sergeant Weidner what his mindset was as he arrived on scene and saw the other deputies
attempting to detain the subject. Sergeant Weidner noted that as a supervisor, he wanted to be able to let
his people “do their job” and be able to help them, but not try to take over as that may cause them to
back off and expect him to handle the situation. Sergeant Weidner described it as “a fine line” and
situations like these would require him to “know” his “troops” and assess the situation to determine
when intervention as a supervisor was necessary. Sergeant Weidner said he decided his deputies were
doing “just fine” when he first arrived as they were giving commands and were not rushing to try and hit
the subject with a baton. Sergeant Weidner said he noted his deputies were going through the use of
force continuum and expressed his opinion that “they exercised great restraint”. Sergeant Weidner said
he did eventually give commands to the subject when the subject was on the ground the first time.
Sergeant Weidner said he was attempting to end the situation by trying to grab the subject and get him to
roll over; however Sergeant Weidner told me “that was not gonna happen. This guy had super human
strength”. I asked Sergeant Weidner what commands he was giving and he recalled telling the subject
“stop resisting” and “roll-over on your stomach”. Sergeant Weidner talked about his experiences with
the Taser and noted that typically when a person is hit with the Taser from the front, they will fall over
on their back “like a board” and when they are told to roll over, they will do it quickly as they do not
want to receive a second activation.

Sergeant Weidner was unable to provide specific information regarding what the subject was saying
prior to the first Taser deployment. He estimated he was “a good twenty feet away” when Deputy Wang
first deployed the Taser. Sergeant Weidner explained that he quickly approached and covered the
distance when he saw the subject go down from the Taser deployment. From this position he was able to
see the subject was laying on his back with his arms tensed up with his hands roughly at the same level
as the subject’s head. Sergeant Weidner reported the subject had what he would describe as a “thousand
yard stare on his face” and was talking straight up toward the sky “like we weren’t even there”. Sergeant
Weidner could not recall precisely what the subject was saying only that it was something similar to
“something God” and he was just “going on”. Sergeant Weidner did recall the subject at one point
saying “What did I do?” but that was after they had already moved over to the northbound lanes of
traffic, just prior to the point where he “assaulted Josh”. Sergeant Weidner said “it was almost as if he
had a second of clarity and then he just kept attacking”. Sergeant Weidner said the whole time the
incident was going on, all the deputies were telling the subject to “stop resisting” and “stop fighting”.
Sergeant Weidner added “we were trying to de-escalate it, but it wasn’t going to happen”.

I asked Sergeant Weidner if there were any other indicators of the subject being under the influence
other than his strength and the “thousand yard stare”. Sergeant Weidner told me the subject was “a very
big guy” and estimated the subject to be approximately six (6) foot or more tall and in the area of 300 to
320 pounds. Sergeant Weidner noted the subject significantly outweighed him and his deputies. Sergeant
Weidner also added his opinion the subject was under the influence of either PCP or “bath salts” given
his experience in having seen people under the influence of both substances and said adding these

SUPPLEMENT 9 - Interview of Sergeant Dave Weidner

substances with the subject’s physical stature meant there “was no stopping a man that size”. Sergeant
Weidner said the key indicator to him that the subject was under the influence of PCP or “bath salts”
was the fact the subject was talking through the Taser deployment and said “you can’t do that, okay?
That does not happen”.

I asked Sergeant Weidner whether he wore any corrective lenses and he told me he does use reading
glasses, but only needs them for reading and has no other vision problems. Sergeant Weidner stated he
had a clear view of what was occurring during the incident and that the lighting conditions were good
due to it being daylight hours at the time the incident took place. Sergeant Weidner did acknowledge that
the exposure to pepper spray did effect his ability to see everything that was going on once the subject
was on the ground the final time.

I asked Sergeant Weidner if he ever transitioned to or deployed any of the less-lethal weapons available
to him during the incident. Sergeant Weidner stated he did not utilize any of his less-lethal options
during the incident and added he already knew one Taser had been ineffective in incapacitating the
subject and knew his Taser would have had the same effect. Sergeant Weidner stated he knew his pepper
spray would also be ineffective since it had already been deployed and was not effective. Sergeant
Weidner also explained his belief the baton or ASP would also not be effective on a person of that size.
Sergeant Weidner said he knew the next level of escalation was deadly force and he was trying to avoid
that when the subject was taken to the ground and he was instructing the other deputies to “get on top of
him”. Sergeant Weidner clarified that he did have his Taser out briefly when he first arrived on scene,
but when he saw Deputy Wang’s Taser was not working on the subject, he put his away. Sergeant
Weidner explained to me that as a Taser instructor, he instructs Deputies that if one Taser is not working
on a subject, the other will not work either and for them not to deploy it in those situations. I asked
Sergeant Weidner about the use of the carotid restraint and whether he or any of the deputies involved
deployed that technique in their attempts to subdue the subject. Sergeant Weidner stated he did not use
the carotid and from his vantage point, he was able to see each of the other deputies and he was
confident none of them used the carotid restraint on the subject.

I asked Sergeant Weidner about the involvement of Community Service Officer (CSO) Joey Gonzales at
the scene and Sergeant Weidner confirmed CSO Gonzales’ presence at the tail end of the incident and
believed it was CSO Gonzales who handed him a set of handcuffs at one point during the struggle to get
the subject detained. Sergeant Weidner said he recalled seeing a “flash of light blue”, which he believed
to be the light blue uniform worn by CSO Gonzales, which was why he believed it was CSO Gonzales
who handed him the handcuffs. Sergeant Weidner said his vision was blurred from the effects of the
pepper spray by that point and he was struggling to keep his eyes open so he could not be positive it was
CSO Gonzales. I asked Sergeant Weidner if this was CSO Gonzales’ only involvement in in the
incident and Sergeant Weidner said he believed it was. Sergeant Weidner added that he had been yelling
out for a pair of handcuffs at the time and thought CSO Gonzales ran over to provide them to him.
Sergeant Weidner said he did not know CSO Gonzales was present at the scene until he handed him the

handcuffs.

I asked Sergeant Weidner if he had ever seen this subject or had any contact with him prior to the
incident on October 3, 2018. Sergeant Weidner stated “I’ve never seen him before a day in my life” and
added “I don’t even know his name”. I asked Sergeant Weidner if he had any injuries as a result of the
incident. Sergeant Weidner indicated he had some soreness in his back and legs from exertion in taking
the subject into custody and some residual effects from the pepper spray, but no physical injuries or
anything which required medical attention. I noted a scratch on Sergeant Weidner’s right hand and asked
him if that occurred during the incident and he stated it did; however he was unsure as to how or when
exactly he was scratched. I asked Sergeant Weidner if he took any medications which might affect his
reactions or abilities to perceive situations and Sergeant Weidner stated he does not take any
medications.

Sergeant Weidner told me he has been a member of the Sheriffs Office Range Training staff for
approximately ten (10) years and is currently one of the lead firearms instructors for the Sheriff’s Office.
Sergeant Weidner said he is certified as both a handgun and rifle instructor and as his collateral duties on
the range staff, he is both a Taser and an OC (pepper spray) instructor. Sergeant Weidner said he teaches
courses on these topics to new deputies and certifies the deputies in the use of the Taser and pepper
spray. Sergeant Weidner said the training class put on by the Sheriff's Office for certification in the use
of the Taser is an eight (8) hour course which includes instruction on how to operate the Taser, policies
specific to Taser deployment and liability related topics. Sergeant Weidner said he attended a two (2)
day class put on by the Alameda County Sheriffs Office to become certified as a Taser instructor.
Sergeant Weidner described the topics of the course as being very similar to the class he puts on for new
deputies and explained that during the period he went through the course, instructors were required to
take a full five (5) second deployment from the Taser before they could be certified; however that is no
longer a requirement of the course. Sergeant Weidner stated he was given the option of having the Taser
prongs attached to his clothing with clips or to be shot with the prongs. Sergeant Weidner said he chose
to be shot with the Taser prongs in a real deployment to experience the affects. Sergeant Weidner added
that he did not recommend anyone else doing the same and said he has since refused to volunteer for
receiving any Taser “hits” during his recertification course.

Sergeant Weidner stated he is not a trainer in either the ASP or in defensive tactics, but had regularly
attended POST mandated perishable skills training in regards to tactical communications, defensive
tactics and the ASP. Sergeant Weidner indicated his belief the Sheriff's Office requires deputies to
attend defensive tactics training “once a year”. In addition to the standard first-aid training he receives
from the agency each year, Sergeant Weidner said he also attended an eight (8) hour “Tactical Medical
School” put on by the Department of Homeland Security approximately one (1) year ago. Sergeant
Weidner said this course primarily covered the use of tourniquets and emergency medicine in the field.

Sergeant Weidner said he has been certified in Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and has attended the

school twice during his career. Sergeant Weidner added he is familiar with de-escalation and was
attempting to de-escalate the situation on October 3, 2018 and trying to prevent the situation from
escalating to deadly force. I asked Sergeant Weidner if he had success previously in de-escalating
situations utilizing his CIT training and he said “yes, absolutely”.

I resumed the interview after a short break and asked Sergeant Weidner some clarifying questions. I
asked Sergeant Weidner if he knew the reason deputies were trying to stop the subject. Sergeant
Weidner said he did not know the reason for the stop when he responded to the incident until he spoke
very briefly with Deputy Wang when Deputy Wang was in an ambulance being prepared to be taken to
the hospital. Sergeant Weidner said he did hear Deputy Wang say over the radio the subject was running
in and out of traffic and was running from Deputy Wang. I asked Sergeant Weidner why he might want
to contact someone under those specific circumstances. Sergeant Weidner explained to me that it
sounded to him as if the subject was behaving as if he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol and
the subject’s running in and out of traffic made him a danger both to members of the public and to
himself. Sergeant Weidner added, “no normal person runs in and out of traffic”. Sergeant Weidner
confirmed the incident occurred on El Camino Real, a busy roadway. Sergeant Weidner added that this
specific portion of El Camino Real is a very high traffic area and told me the City of Millbrae constantly
has accidents occur where pedestrians are being struck by cars.

Sergeant Weidner said that if he had been the one initially trying to detain the subject, his goal would
have been to detain the subject, see if the subject was under the influence of a controlled substance, get
the subject medical attention and evaluate the suspect as a possible danger to himself and others and
then possibly place him on a mental health hold.

I asked some more questions in regards to when Sergeant Weidner saw the subject grabbing Deputy
Wang’s firearm. More specifically, I asked him to describe in more detail how the subject was holding
or grabbing the firearm. Sergeant Weidner described Deputy Wang as standing straight up and the
subject as having bent down and trying to put his shoulder into Deputy Wang’s waist. Sergeant Weidner
said rather than wrap his hands and arms around Deputy Wang’s waist, the subject placed his hand on
Deputy Wang’s holstered gun. Sergeant Weidner described the subject as grasping the holster and the
upper portion of the firearm, where it extended out above the holster. Sergeant Weidner said he could
not say for sure if the subject attempted to pull on the holster and firearm or not.

Iasked Sergeant Weidner if he was able to see if the Taser probe was still in the subject’s forearm when
he was trying to place the subject in handcuffs towards the end of the altercation. Sergeant Weidner said
he could see the probe was still in the subject’s arm and speculated the probe was what cause the
scratch/cut to Sergeant Weidner’s hand as his hand kept slipping on the blood in the location of the
probe.

I asked Sergeant Weidner to walk me through what emotions he was feeling and what concerns he had

during the incident. Sergeant Weidner said his only real concern was the safety of his deputies and he
wanted to make sure they were okay. Sergeant Weidner said he feared he and his deputies were going to
be in an officer involved shooting because “we had done everything possible to try and restrain this guy.
We used every escalation of force possible. Every de-escalation of force possible. I knew Deputy Watt
was completely incapacitated from pepper spray. I knew Deputy Lorenzatti was incapacitated because
she kept telling me she couldn’t see. I was probably about thirty (30) percent incapacitated, but I could
still force open one of my eyes. Um, so I knew that if this guy got up off the ground, I was going to have
to shoot him. So we were doing everything we could to try and avoid a deadly force situation”.

At the culmination, I allowed Sarah Burdick to ask any questions she might have for Sergeant Weidner.
Sarah Burdick asked Sergeant Weidner if the fact the subject was able to get up “almost immediately”
after the first Taser deployment indicated anything to him. Sergeant Weidner said this was what first
indicated to him the subject was under the influence of a controlled substance. Sergeant Weidner said
that from his own experience with having felt the effect of the Taser he knew “your muscles lock up”
and indicated that upon the five (5) second activation ending, a person’s body will relax and they will be
feeling relief the activation is over. Sergeant Weidner said the subject’s ability to immediately jump up
at the end of the five (5) second deployment indicated to him “he’s got drug on-board”. Sergeant
Weidner went on to say the biggest indicators to him that the subject was likely on either PCP or “bath
salts” was the fact it appeared to him the subject was not experiencing any pain as well as “his literally
super-human strength”. I asked Sergeant Weidner if he has ever attended formal training in regards to
the recognition of persons under the influence of controlled substance. Sergeant Weidner stated he has
taken multiple courses in his career to recognize controlled substance influence and his experience in the
jail working as an “intake deputy” would frequently expose him to numerous people coming in under the
influence. Sergeant Weidner indicated he also has had experience in contacting, evaluating and arresting
persons who are under the influence during his career.

I asked Sergeant Weidner based upon his experience as a Taser instructor, if mental health conditions
can also play a factor in the effectiveness of the Taser. Sergeant Weidner told me mental health can be a
factor, but several of the indicators he observed with this specific subject led him to believe the subject’s
actions were due to being under the influence and not due to mental health issues.

Sarah Burdick asked Sergeant Weidner a final series of questions regarding whether or not Sergeant
Weidner had seen any MAV footage or news footage taken by bystanders of this incident prior to our
interview and Sergeant Weidner stated he had not viewed any video of the incident.

Okay. Um, did you have any alcohol during the off hours?

No - not - not - not that night, no.

Okay. Um, so you started at 5:00 in the morning.

Yes.

So, I assume there were quite a few calls for service during that time period.
However as a sergeant you’re not typically responding to many calls. Um, did
you respond to some of the calls for service that day?

Yes, that day I did when my team was fully 10-8 in service. I typically will
respond to certain calls, um, depending on what they are. Um, sometimes if
I’m out and about just roaming around, I’ll just show up, uh, to cover them,
um, or be involved or I’ll respond.

Okay. And were any of those other calls stressful?

I wouldn’t classify ‘em as stressful.

Um, would you classify them as routine?

Um, yeah, I mean I’ve been on pa- I - prior to becoming promoted to sergeant
I had - I was on s- patrol for ten years.

Okay.

So, my experience is very different than somebody who has maybe a couple
years on.

Right.

so, um, so, there’s a couple calls I went to with Deputy Watt that day. Uh, first
thing in the morning we got a call of a transient lady walking down the street
that looked like she needed assistance, so we went there. She was kinda
combative, we calmed her down. Um, were able to get her assistance that she
needed. But really she just wanted to get on the BART train and go to
Oakland. Uh, the next call we had after that was, um, we get a lot of transients
that get off at the Millbrae BART station.

And they come into our city. The next call after that was, uh, Deputy Watt
contacted a transient at the, uh, BART station who then began to a- assault
him and he called for code three cover. We all responded to that. Uh, once we
subdued the suspect that in that call he had $20,000 warrant out of our agency
- $80,000 warrant out of Southern California and a $5,000 warrant out of So-
uh, San Francisco I think it was. So he was arrested and booked. The call after
that was, um, a gentleman who refused to sign a citation. Um, so I just
responded to that. ‘Cause re- I was requested and, uh, I was able to get him to
sign the citation and explain to him, you know, go to court.

Mm-kay. Um, we’ll go backwards to I guess the - the two prior transient
contacts. But we’ll start with the earlier one. you remarked...

Yes sir.

...about the woman being combative.

Mmm.

Was she physically combative or argumentative or...

She was argumentative and they - when they tried to detain her to help her,
um, she just tried pulling away from them. She didn’t, like, try to hit them or
anything like that.

Mm-kay. So it was not really a use of force incident? Her...

No, we detained her.

But...

We detained her and put her in handcuffs for, um, because she, you know, she
was trying to pull away and flail. So for our safety we put her in handcuffs -

yes.

And that was just done physically hands on as opposed to use of, like, a Taser
or other weapons?

Oh, yeah - yeah.
Okay. And then the second one - the one that sounds like it was far more...
Mm-hm.

..confrontational and more combative. Can you describe what occurred in

that? At least from when you were involved?
Well he requested, uh, at the time he contacted and I heard him ca- call on the
radio he - he needed code three cover ‘cause the guy was combative with him.
By the time I arrived at the call we, um, it was at the Millbrae, uh, BART
station at the top of the platform. So, as we ran up the stairs they already had
him in - down on the ground in handcuffs.
So the person had already been detained...
Yeah.
..by the time you got there?
By the time I got there, yes, it was over.
Okay. So it was code four...

Mm-hm. Yes.

..at that point? Okay. Um, and so you obviously - you did not really have to
do anything to detain that person yourself?

No, not at all.

Okay. Mm-kay. Let’s talk about the actual call - the - the reason we’re here
now.

Sure.

if you can just kind of walk me through from the beginning when you first
become aware of radio traffic or even with that through to - to the end and,
you know, I’ll let you kinda tell the story first. I may have some questions.
But I’m for the most part gonna let you just kinda walk me through everything
that you remember.

Sure, no problem. So...

I’m sorry, not to interrupt, but before we do that did you want to give him the
modified Beheler advisement?

Mm-mm.

No? We don’t need that...

He is free to leave obviously.
Yeah.

This is a voluntary statement. Um, you’ve spoken with your attorney about
that...

Mm-hm.

..and you’re willing to provide this statement voluntarily?
Yes, I’m good.

Okay.

We're good.

Uh, now if you - and - go ahead and tell me the story.

Yeah, all right, no problem. So we had just finished eating lunch together as a
team. Um, and the guys were gonna get back on the street. I went into my
office, I started doing my administrative work. Um, I think I heard him say on
the radio, uh, his call sign was, uh - uh, Boy 62...

And by him we’re talking about officer...
We're - officer - by — Josh Wang...
Okay.

Deputy Josh Wang Um, so Deputy Josh Wang, uh, said he was gonna try to
make a ped stop, where he was gonna be out with somebody. Uh, then he said,
um, he ran from me and now he’s running in traffic. Um, so, we all started
responding, uh, ‘cause we were concerned that it was probably gonna - it m-
could of escalated and plus this guy’s running in traffic so now we have
another s- you know, safety concern. So we arrived on sce- uh, as I was
getting up out of my chair to start walking to my car he requested code 3
cover. So, we all raced out there to the scene, and, uh - uh, he put out on the
radio again, he’s running in traffic. Um, so once we got there, um, I purposely
positioned my vehicle - so I pulled into the southbound lanes - I pulled in
opposite direction f- with my MAV video on - ‘cause I actually wanted to
capture the incident on, um, on video. When I got there I was obs- um, my
vision was kind of obstructed by the, um, the tel- the light pole right there. But
I could see, um, the black male adult that he was trying to contact. Um, so as I
got out of the car I saw the guy had his hands straight up in the air. So, I

figure, um, Deputy Lorenzatti arrived right next to me. Um, Deputy Watt
arrived. I don’t know where he parked. Um, but, uh, so I saw Jo- Deputy Josh
Wang approach the suspect. I thought he was just gonna grab his arm, put him
in handcuffs. I thought he was going to be compliant. And what I saw after
that was the guy pulled his arms down turned and I think he pushed Deputy
Wang. And at that point Deputy Wang drew his Taser, uh, and I saw him
deploy the Taser. Um, the suspect then started staggering back. I could tell he
had a good Taser deployment. Um, he start- he staggered back and he fell
down on the ground. And as I was monitoring h- the suspect, and um, Deputy
Wang, ‘cause I wanted to make sure he wouldn’t keeping his finger in the
trigger ‘cause the Taser will continuously keep going. And I’m - I’m a Taser
instructor so I look for these things, okay? Um, I saw that he had a probe in
the forearm and a probe in the body - right around the chest area. Uh, so the
suspect fell flat on his back and when he did I could tell the suspect was under
the influence ‘cause he was staring straight up at the sky and he was talking to
God. And I’ve been tased as an instructor and you’re not talking. The only
thing you’re doing is either screaming or you’re gonna be quiet. There’s
nothing you can do. This guy was talking through the Taser to God. At that
point I figured he had to be under the influence of some PCP or some bath
salts. As the five second deployment stopped. I went to grab the suspect’s arm
to try to roll him over. He - and he literally pulled away from me like I wasn’t
even there. In fact he pulled me off balance so I let go. Because I knew that if
I fell on the wires I was gonna get the next deployment.

Okay.

Okay? The suspect then got up, um, I mean he just leapt up. And as soon as he
got up Deputy Wang, um, deployed a secondary five, uh, second burst. Uh,
the suspect went back down on the ground. Uh, we tried to grab him and roll
him over, um, but, he - he was just pulling away from us. He was way too
strong. Um, at that point I saw one of the wires was broke. So I knew that the
Taser - his Taser was going to be ineffective at that point.

Okay.

Um, ‘cause even if he had turn- cycled it, I knew it was not going to have any
effect because he had to complete the cycle by doing a drive stun with the
probe in and I knew that that was not gonna happen. So, the suspect got up
and he started running diagonal across the intersection into the northbound
traffic lanes. Deputy Wang and Deputy Watt, Deputy Lorenzatti and Deputy
DeMartini was al- was there at that point ‘cause I saw ‘em out of the corner of
my eye. We followed o- we followed over, uh, to try and get the suspect in
custody. He was yelling something incoherent. I don’t know what he was
yelling. He was yelling something about God and he was - I think he was
talking to - he - he acted like he was actually talking to God and, like, we

weren’t there. Then he yelled out something else and I - incoherent - I - I
didn’t remember what that was. Uh, but Deputy Wang then deployed his ASP
and, um, uh, I don’t know if Deputy Wang made contact with him. Because at
one point I saw - I knew Deputy Wang had been struck by the suspect because
I actually saw his ASP and his Taser literally fly through the air. Um, then we
managed to surround the suspect. And the suspect then, um, lowered his
center of gravity - he basically ah, line - he was gonna - he was trying to
linebacker tackle Josh. And basically, lowered his center of gravity and he
went to pull, you know, grab his legs and pull him off balance and take Josh to
his back. At that point I saw the suspect it was actu- had - had his gun. And I
was worried at that point that we were gonna be in a OIS. Because we had
literally escalated through our entire use of force. We escalate - we did verbal,
we did, uh, Taser, we did baton, um, and the last one OC was coming next.
Um, but somehow the suspect went to the ground. I - I don’t know how he
went, maybe he tripped - I don’t - ’m just speculating that. But once he was
on the ground I told everyone to get on top of him. Because I wanted to -
maybe think - maybe we could just control him and we could get more units
there. ‘Cause I think I called for code three cover at that point. S- I called for
additional units and then everyone started coming. San Bruno started coming,
our Transit Bureau started coming. So, once we got on top of him, um, Deputy
DeMartini was down by the feet, Deputy Lorenzatti was on the legs. Um, I
was trying to get his right arm where the Taser probe was. Uh, and the reason
I remember that is ‘cause he was bleeding pretty profusely and my hands were
slipping off of him because of all the blood. But I knew I couldn’t let go of
that arm. I had to try to get it behind his back. Um, and then I was told it was
Deputy Wang who deployed the OC. But when he went to - I think what he
did was he positioned it to try to get under the suspect’s face. But what
happened is, um, is when he deployed it it completely missed the suspect.
Deputy Watt took a direct hit to the face. Deputy Lorenzatti took a direct hit
and I received the splash back of all that. Um, Deputy Watt was completely
incapacitated. Um, I knew there was no way he could continue, um, and
“cause he couldn’t breathe, so, he had to back off. Um, Deputy Lorenzatti, um,
she - she told me the same thing. She was starting to yell - I think she was
yelling, “Sarge, I can’t breathe - I can’t see Sarge.” Um, and I, um, and I told
her, you know, “Hey, you just hang in there, stay in this fight, um, we- we
need to get this guy into custody.” Um, and I think I told her I was - I was hit
too, ‘cause I knew I was.

Okay.

So, um, I managed to pull his arm out from under him and get it behind his
back. I - I yelled out, “I need handcuffs - I need handcuffs.” Somebody put a
pair of handcuff- one handcuff on him and I said I need a second pair because
the guy was - there was no way we were getting his hands behind his back
with one pair. Um, somebody - I don’t know who - uh, locked up the second

pair of handcuffs. Um, and I think Deputy Wang was successful in getting his,
uh, other arm behind his back and he was able to get handcuffed. Um, once
we got handcuffed, um, I immediately became - became concerned for
positional asphyxiation for the suspect ‘cause I knew we were on top of him.
So, I w- told everyone to get off of him and sit him up. I wanted to sit him up,
like, immediately. So I think within maybe ten seconds I had him sitting up.
Um, and as soon as he sat up, um, I checked his pulse - he had a pulse. He was
- he was, uh, not responsive. Uh, but then all of a sudden he woke up and he
was looking around. Um, and then from there, uh, I had the fire medics come
in ‘cause they were staging. Uh, I knew I had three deputies that were hurt at
the time. Uh, so I just started, you know, following our protocol. I wanted to
set up a crime scene. So, we started setting up crime scene tape. Um, I called
for our, uh, ca- captain Alpha 7, uh, ‘cause I needed - I needed a supervisor at
the scene. Uh, I think I started directing everyone to start at that point - start
getting witness statements. Um, I saw that Deputy Josh Wang at that point
was bleeding pretty profusely from the face. So, I wanted to get him, uh,
medical attention right way. ‘Cause I - I honestly didn’t know how or what
injuries he sustained. Um, Deputy Watt, um, a city worker had stopped and
got out of the car started pouring water on Deputy Watt’s eyes, so I knew he’d
be okay. Um, then we - I was trying to attend to Lorenzatti but at the same
time I’m trying to watch the suspect. Um, and Deputy DeMartini was he- he
was okay, he wasn’t hurt. Um, so at that point I think it was more just starting
to get the crime scene set up. Get that guy medical attention right away. Um,
and so the paramedics were attending to all of our deputies and then he at
some - he at some point, um, just - I - I looked over and I saw he was alert, he
was looking around. And then the paramedics were attending to him and all of
a sudden, uh, he just - he coded. And the paramedic - he, uh, was yelling to
the captain, “Hey, I need the, uh, I need to get the, uh, the heart monitor on
him.” But he didn’t hear him ‘cause he was attending to one of my guys. And,
so, I went over and I told him, I say, “Hey, man, this guy needs that right now.
He - that guy’s dying.” And so, they all started working on him. And, uh, so
as soon I knew that happened I just started following the - our protocol to try
and get everything going.

Okay. You talked about a couple other, uh, call signs, like Joshua Wang’s and,
uh, Captain Kunkel’s. What was your call sign for that?

Uh, Sam 60.
Okay. Do you remember the other officer’s call signs?

Yes, Deputy Lorenzatti is, uh, Boy 61 and Deputy DeMartini is Boy 40 - he
was assigned to the Eichler Highlands that day.

Okay. And Watt?

Uh, he’s Boy 60.

Okay. Um, you talked about, um, leaving the station - hearing the call -
leaving the station. You said, “We all were leaving.” Who is, “We all?”

I think Deputy Lorenzatti was in front of me. Um, she was the only one I think
was in front of me. I don’t remember how long behind me, uh, Deputy
DeMartini was. So...

But you were - three were at the station together prior to that?

Yes.

Okay. And you knew that all three of you were leaving the station at the same
time?

Yeah, of course, anyone calls code 3 cover...

Right.

..everybody’s coming.

Okay. When, um, Officer Watt was - not s- Officer Wang - when Officer
Wang was putting out initial information - did he ever provide a de-

description of the - the subject?

Not that I recall. I just heard he said I have a subject that is running through
traffic.

Okay.

I don’t recall him putting out an actual description.

So when you got there and saw somebody...

Yeah.

.-how did you know that that was the person?

Oh, ‘cause we all, uh, ‘cause I saw Deputy Wang’s ...pull his vehicle up. H-
that was the only guy on the sidewalk. And i- uh, as we were pulling up he

immediately threw his hands up in the air.

There was no one else around so I figured that was the guy.

Okay. And - you can correct me if I’m wrong on this - but I believe what you
said was that they had already kinda engaged with him...

Yes.
..aS you’re approaching...
Yes.

...S0, what was your thought process coming into there? Did you feel like you
needed to help them get him under control right away or were you trying to
assess the scene - what was your kinda mindset right then?

Well, it’s - it’s hard as a supervisor - as a sergeant - because you wanna let
them do their job - you wanna help them - but then if you try to take over
they’ ll back off. So, i- it’s a fine line and you have to be a- you have to know
the - know the - know your troops. Know - be able to assess the scene. Assess
what’s going on. And you, eh, you have to make that decision of when you
think intervention is, um, necessary. Uh, clearly if I saw - well - I decided they
were doing just fine at the time. Uh, especially, um, they were - they were
giving commands. Uh, I didn’t see them rush and, you know, try to, you
know, hit a baton or use ASP - they were - I saw they were going through, uh,
the use of force continuum. They exerc- uh, my opinion - they exercised great
restraint. So, I felt there was no need to intervene. I felt it was good, uh, to let
it go. Even I - at some point I think I was giving commands - when he fell
down. Um, I was trying to end it right then and there by grabbing him and
rolling him over, but that was not gonna happen. This guy had superhuman
strength.

What were some of the commands that you were giving him if you
remember?

Stop resisting, I think, uh, roll over on your stomach. Uh, ‘cause when people
get tased unless you tase ‘em in the back - if you tase ‘em in the front they
obviously go right on their backs. They go stiff like a board. So, usually when
you tell ‘em roll over they wanna roll over really fast. Because they don’t
want it again. And that’s when we can, uh, handcuff ‘em.

Okay.

Uh, but this guy was not - that was not happening.

You talked a little bit about him talking to God or whatever.
Yeah.

Do you remember hearing him say anything specific kinda leading up to that
before he gets tased?

No, I didn’t - I did not hear that - anything that he said, uh, because I was
probably a good 20 feet away, uh, from Josh when he tased him. But when h-
uh, the suspect assaulted Josh, uh, he started moving towards me. When Josh
tased him he fell down and I was pretty much clearing the distance right away.
So, as he was laying there the suspect was on his back with his arms like this.
And he had this - this 1,000 yard stare on his face and he was literally talking
straight up, like, we were not even there. He was talking, uh...

Do you recall what he was sayin’ when he was talking?

No, he just some- he was saying something God - something God. And he was
just going on.

Okay. Um, at any point do you recall anything that he said specifically or just
- was it hard to recall or is it - was it - difficult to understand him?

No, it wasn’t difficult it was - at one point he yelled out, “What did I do?”
Okay.

Um, but I think that was across when he had - were - already come across and
reengaging him. But after he yelled, “What did I do?” Um, then he turned
around he - he started assaulting Josh again and he started assaulting every
one of us. So it was like he had a second of clarity and then he just kept
attacking.

Okay.

And the whole time everyone was yelling, “Get down on the ground. Stop
resisting. Stop fighting.” I mean we were trying to deescalate it but it was not
gonna happen.

You’ve talked about his strength.

Yes.

Where you perceive the strength. Um, is there any other things that you
noticed about him about him than kinda the 1,000 yard stare and the strength -

were there other indicators to you that he was possibly under the influence or
anything that you noticed about...

Well he was a very big guy. Um, I would say he’s probably a little over 6 foot.
Probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 - 320 pounds. Um, and, you
know, I know Deputy Josh Wang. He’s about as tall as I am - maybe 59” -
5°10”. He’s probably about 160 pounds. Uh, Deputy Lorenzatti, a small
female. Um, so, I mean this guy has significantly outweighed us.

Yeah.

And then if you add the fact that whatever drugs he had onboard. Um, I’m
guessing - I believed he probably had PCP or bath salts - ‘cause I’ve seen
people on both. Um, you add that in there and there’s just no stopping a man

that size.

Yeah. Um, is that based kinda on his reactions to the Taser and things like that
or were there other kinda objective symptoms that you noted?

Well, like, n- no, I didn’t have time to observe his pupils...

Right.

..1f that’s what you’re getting at. I never take his pulse or anything like that.
The symptoms that led me to believe that he was under the influence, of, uh,
something like PCP or bath salts is when he was laying on his back and he
was getting tased for the five seconds - he was able to talk. You can’t do that,
okay? It - it does not happen. He was able to talk to God when he was doing
that. And that’s when I knew, um, he’s under the influence of either PCP or
bath salts or something like that.

Okay. Do you, uh, wear any corrective lenses or any...

Ido.

Okay.

I wear reading glasses.

No.

on?

Correct.

Okay. And lighting conditions were - were...
It was daylight.

Right. Uh...

Approximately 1:00 in the afternoon or something, like, right around that
time.

I think that you talked about the only - you mentioned the light pole kinda
blocking some visibility initially. Was there anything else that was kinda

obstructing your view at any points in time?

Not that I recall - no. Not when they made initial contact. After that
everything was clear.

Okay.

“Cause he was coming, like, towards me.

And when you were kinda essentially piled up on him on the ground...

I was driving a Ford Explorer SUV - fully outfitted - full sheriff markings -
full light bar - everything.

With video. We’ve talked about - about the MAV video.

Yes I have MAV video in my vehicle and my MAV video was on and | also
had my microphone on which I think captured all the audio.

Okay. Is that something that activated automatically or something that you
have to activate?

So [have to activate it. So in the morning, um, what we do is we get in the car
- we take out the microphone and put it on a - we turn it over, turn it on - put it
on our vests. And anytime you turn the, uh, position switch to number two -
the record goes on in there. There’s an audio beep and you see it’s recording
and then our a- your, um, audio turns on.

By position two you’re talking about on the lighting equipment?

Correct. On the lighting equipment. To take - to the take - front take down red.
Was all the equipment in the vehicle functioning properly?

Yes.

Yep. And all of your equipment on you - was it functioning properly?

Yes.

Um, at any point did you, um, transition to any of your weapons that were
available to you? Your less-lethal weapons or anything?

No I did not. Because I already knew that the Taser didn’t work. So, me
deploying my Taser was gonna have the same effect.

Okay.

I already knew, uh, well we were already pepper sprayed. So, uh, that wasn’t
gonna work, um, ‘cause we were - we were all pepper sprayed at that point.
The baton was clearly not gonna work on a man this size. Um, so, I knew that
the next escalation of force was, um, to use deadly force. And when he went
to the ground I was trying to avoid that by telling everyone to get on top of
him. So I was trying to avoid a deadly force situation.

Yeah. So, there was never any time where you would have had your Taser out

or your ASP out or...
I did take my Taser out...
Okay.
..at one point when I initially got out of the car. But when I saw the - he - that
his Taser was not working, then as an instructor I tell people, hm, then you
don’t tase him. If - if one’s not working yours not gonna work any better. So, I

- I put it away.

Okay. Um, when he was on the ground were there any holds that were used -
something like the carotid or anything like that to your knowledge?

No, we did not use the carotid.

Okay. And you certainly did not?

No, I did not.

No? Did you clear view of what everybody else was doing?

Yes.

Okay. And nobody did?

No, nobody did.

Okay.

He was on, uh, his stomach, um, over on his right side stomach and he was,
you know, on his right side roll into his stomach. And we were try- I was
trying to get him there ‘cause I was trying to pull his right arm behind him.
Okay. Other than obviously wearing full uniform anything like - do you recall
ever - either yourself or hearing the other officers identifying themselves as
police officers to him or anything like that?

No, I - I do not, no.

No?

Okay.

..fully marked, uh, Sheriff's Office patrol vehicles.

Okay. Um, at some point in time and one of the CSOs is there?

Correct.

Involved as well. Do you recall where he was and what he was doing?

Uh, I think he gave me a pair of handcuffs. I think he was the one that leaned
in and gave me a pair of handcuffs. Um, and as the reason I say I think is
because I was fighting to keep my eyes open from the pepper spray. So, what
I was seeing was kinda blurred. Um, but I knew I had to try to keep my eyes
open ‘cause everyone else was pretty much out of the fight at this point.
Okay.

Um, and I was trying to encourage them to stay in it.

But there’s - was there something that you saw that made you think that it was
him specifically or...

Yeah, ‘cause I saw a flash of light blue. And they wear, like, baby powder
blue shirts.

Okay. Uh, what’s his name by the way?
Joey Gonzales.

Joey Gonzales, okay. Um, as far as you know that would have been his only
involvement? Is...

Yeah, I don’t think he did anything else.

Okay.

He - he just came over ‘cause I k- I was yelling out, “I need a pair of
handcuffs - I need a pair of handcuffs.” So, I think he just ran over and gave

me a pair of handcuffs. ‘Cause everyone else was already occupied.

Um, as this was evolving did you see that Gonzales was already as well or his

truck was out there or...
I didn’t know he was there until he handed me handcuffs.
Okay.

“Cause I was too focused on the deputies and the suspect.

And the public works people that were out there is that kinda a similar? Did
you see that they were there prior or not until after or...

Not till after, uh, one of the public works guys - he - when we started the
struggle in the intersection he happened just stop - he was in traffic. He just
happened to be there.

Okay.

And, uh, he was the one that actually started rendering aid to Deputy Watt by
giving water. ‘Cause Deputy Watt was yelling, “I need water - I need water to
flush my eyes.” And he actually, uh, was giving him water. And he was
marked - in a city marked vehicle and they were wearing green fluorescent

shirts so that’s why I knew it was a Millbrae city worker.

Okay. And obviously working in Millbrae you interact with some of these
people and see...

Yes, we have a good relationship with them. So that’s how we know ‘em.
And how long have you been assigned to Millbrae again?

So, I just rotated there in March. But, prior to that I was a patrol deputy there
for - since the day we t- well merged with the city. So, I think I was there for
three years as a patrol deputy. I went back to the jail, got promoted to sergeant
about a year and a half later - did about a year and a half in the jail and then I
rotated back there in March of this year.

Okay. So, you’ve been there since March of this year?

Yeah.

Along with working overtime shifts various other locations?

Yes.

Never seen him before a day in my life.
Okay.

I don’t even know his name. Did - did you guys identify him?

They did. I don’t actually recall his name. It’s kind of an odd pronunciation -
I’m not even sure I could pronounce it.

Okay.
But, um, did you receive any injuries from what happened?

Yeah, but no physical injuries that require me to go to the hospital.

Okay. The scratch on the back of your hand is that anything from last...

No.

Okay. Um, so obviously you woulda not felt any effects of medication?
Correct.

Skip some of this stuff - let’s talk about your training. You mentioned, um...
Sure.

...being an instructor. Talk a little bit about as your experience as a Taser
instructor and how you became certified and all that.

So, I, uh, I’m a member of our range staff. I’ve been on our range staff for
approximately ten years. Um, so I’m one of the lead firearm instructors. Um,
certified rifle and handgun instructor and while you’re on the range staff they
give other ancillary duties. So I was sent to tasering school - so I’m a Taser
instructor. Um, I’m also an OC instructor, um, which we just trans- switched
over to a new OC. Uh, so I teach classes - I certify all the new people who
come in. Uh, if they don’t have the Taser training we put on an eight hours
class and then we teach ‘em how to use the Taser and talk about liabilities -
policy and procedure - things like that.

Yep. As the tasering school - what does that consist of?

So we have to go to a two day, uh, Taser school and the one I went to was
hosted in Alameda County. Um, they talk about the, uh, the liabilities, what
the Taser does, who makes it, you know, give you all the background, And the
time I went through, um, you were required to, uh, take a hit, uh, to be
certified. And if you didn’t wanna take a hit they wouldn’t certify you.

The - and was that the - a brief hit or was it a full five seconds?

Full five second ride.

Okay, so...

And I opted to take the probes in the back. So there’s two ways they do it -
they’1l hook on alligator clips to you and then they’ Il tase you or you can
actually get shot with a Taser where the probes deploy. And I chose to get
shot with it ‘cause I wanna be able to experience that.

Okay. And...

And I do not recommend it.

I actually had to be tased when we carried them in my prior agency.
So you know.

So, yes, um, uh, it was not a pleasant experience.

No.

Un, is that the only time you’ve experienced being tased?

Yeah, ‘cause I refused to do it. Even when I got recertified and they asked for
volunteers - I said, “No way man.”

Um in addition to the things you’ve mentioned - you’ve mentioned, um, being
the pepper spray, being the Taser instructor...

Mm-hm. Sure.

Um, any defensive tactics training or, um, training with the ASP - anything
like that?

No, I’m not. Uh, our Def- DT instructors do the control holds and the ASP
training.

Yep. Which you’ve obviously attended courses where you are trained?
Correct. Yes.

Okay. And how frequently do you do that?

Uh, I think we have to do DT once a year.

Okay. And have you done that pretty recently?

I believe so. I can’t recall when the last class was.

Okay. Ultimately we will look at training records and things like that, but...
Sure.

also - I think it was last year - I went to an eight hour tactical medi- m-
medical school put on by the Department of Homeland Security which talked
about how to - the use of tourniquets and emergency medicine in the field.

Okay. Would that have also dealt with some of the things that you would have
been seeing in this incident?

Um, no, the more of the CPR portion was this. Because my primary concern
was his breathing.

Okay.
Um...

Um, how about any training in tactical communications or CIT training or
anything like that?

Yes I’m CIT certified. Um, for some reason I went to two (unintelligible)
school - the school twice. I don’t know why but I felt I needed it. So, uh, but
yes I am certified in CIT. Um, I’m all fr- familiar with de-escalation. I was
trying to de-escalate the situation. Uh, I was also trying to prevent the - the
situation from escalating to deadly force.

Okay. And have you had success in de-escalating situations previously with
your CIT training?

Yes, absolutely.

Um, all right. Is there anything else that you can think of that maybe you
haven’t told me along the way that you think would be important for us to
know right now?

No, I don’t think so. I think I told you everything to the best of my memory.
Okay. We’re gonna take a break for a couple minutes. I’m gonna confer with
my supervisors and certain things outside and let you confer with your

Don’t you have air conditioning in this room?

It’s a good 5 degrees more...

You know what, they do turn it off after hours at some point.
Apparently they do.

Gotta save bill around here.

(Unintelligible) right?

Yeah. Um, so a couple - just a little real quick kinda question. Um, just to
clarify a couple little things that were talked about along the way.

Sure.
Un, we talked a little bit about the initial contact or at least what you saw...
Mm-hm.

..of the initial contact and what you heard on the radio responding. Um, why
were they contacting him?

Uh, so after this was over and Deputy Wang was in the ambulance, um, I
asked him, I said, “Hey, can you just kinda give me a quick brief of what
happened?” And he said, “Well, he darted across traffic, so I was gonna
contact him for jaywalking and then when I went to contact him he started
literally running in and out of traffic.”

Okay. And did you hear some of that information being broadcast, a little
before this? That you responded...

Yes, he was putting it out on the radio - saying that, “Th- he’s running into
traffic. He just ran from me, now he’s running in and out of traffic.” I heard

that on the air.

Okay. And, in your mind why would you wanna contact somebody under
those circumstances?

Oh, it was obvious to me it he sounded like he was under the influence and he
was a danger to himself and other people and the public.

Okay. Because he was going into the roadway?

Right, ‘cause nobody - no normal person runs in and out of traffic. Especially
in Millbrae.

And this was on El Camino Real.
Yes.
Mmm, a very busy street?

It was - that area is very behind traffic. I mean the El Camino is very busy, but
Millbrae constantly has auto/peds. So, that area is very - very busy.

Okay. Um, in their attempts to, um, contact him, mmm, initially, um, what do
you think they were trying to accomplish in contacting him and detaining?

Well probably what I would of done if I was in their position - let’s detain him
- let’s see if he’s under the influence - let’s get him medical attention. Uh,
let’s see if he’s a danger to others - we’ll place him on a 5150 hold. ‘Cause if
he’s under the influence, clearly he can’t be, uh, let go. We have to get him
medical attention.

Okay. Um, now jumping forward a little bit to kinda the second area when
he’s over by...

Sure.
...the CSO truck and kinda the - kinda the end point if you will. Um, you

mentioned that he was grabbing, um, Officer Wang or Deputy Wang’s
firearm. How was he grabbing it?

So, he - when he went to linebacker tackle him and what I mean by that is
Deputy Wang was standing straight up this guy bent down and he tried to sh-
put his shoulder into his waist. So he went for that, um, most people try to
grab the legs ‘cause they wanna sweep you. He went specifically and reached
around and grabbed his gun.

And so how was he holding? Was he holding, like, kinda (unintelligible)...
Like this.

...like the holster or the (unintelligible)?

He had his hand on the gun and the holster.

Okay.

Kinda like the handle and, you know...

Okay.

Um, and well I can’t say for sure - I can’t say if I saw him try to pull it - I
can’t say that.

Just - just that he had a hold of it?

Yes.

Okay. Um, when - did - you talk about the blood on his arm.
Yes.

And being very slippery and you talked about it being from the probe. Was
the probe still in his arm at that point in time?

Yes it was.

So you saw the probe in his arm?

Correct. ‘Cause I think the probe - I’m - I’m speculating, but I think that the
probe is what cut me. ‘Cause me - I kept sliding ‘cause all the blood. I kept - I

- I could not let go of that arm. So...

Okay. Um, and then kinda the last area is run me through some of kinda your
emotions through this whole thing and how you were feeling and what

concerns you had ...

The only concerns I had were the safety for my deputies. I wanted to make
sure they were okay.

And what did you fear could happen?

I feared we were gonna be in a OIS. Um, we had - we did everything possible
to - to restrain this guy. We used every escalation of force possible or de-
escalation of force possible. I knew Deputy Watt was completely
incapacitated from pepper spray. I knew Deputy Loren - Lorenzatti was
incapacitated ‘cause she kept telling me she couldn’t see. Um, I was, um,
probably about 30% incapacitated. I could still o- force open one of my eyes.
Um, so I knew that if this guy got off of the ground I was gonna have to shoot
him. So we were doing everything we could to try to avoid a deadly force
situation.

Mm-kay. Do you have anything else that you would like to ask?

Yeah, just a few follow up questions. Um, we were talking about how you
didn’t have time to notice really signs or symptoms of being the - under the
influence. But certain things that the subject was doing at the scene led you to
believe he could be, um, under the influence or 11-5 right?

Right.

Um, so, uh, it - did the fact that he was able to get up almost immediately after
being tased that first time indicate anything to you about that?

Yeah, that’s what told me he was under the influence. Because as you know
from being tased and as I know from being tased - your muscles lock up. And
usually after you lock up and the five seconds ride over you kinda just - you
know, you’re like, “Oh, my gosh.” Well when that five second ride was over
with him he just sprung right back up. And knew right away I go, “He’s - he’s
got drugs - he’s got drugs on board.” Um, and the second time he hit - he went
down - same thing - he sprung back up. That’s why we ended up on the
opposite of the El Camino.

And so in your training and experience I’m guessing you’re familiar with
people who have, uh, who you have observed under the influence of a
numerous amount of drugs, right?

Yes.

And, um, specifically stimulants...

Stimulants, opioids, uh, whatever you...
PCP, bath salts...
Yes.

..any of that kinda stuff? Um, and so in your experience, uh, someone under
the influence do they register pain necessarily like someone who is not?

No, they typically, um, the - the biggest indicator is that he - to me what I
believe was either PCP or bath salts is his lack of feeling any pain.

Mm-hm.
And his literally super human strength.
Okay.

Um, and just touching off of that real quickly. Like, she kinda went down this
area, but, have you had any formal training in 11-5 or DRE or anything like
that?

Yes, I’ve been to, uh, several 11-5 schools. Um, I don’t know exactly when -
what years. Um, plus you - when you worked as an intake deputy you literally
see 1,000’s of people coming through under every drug, alcohol, whatever
you can imagine - you see it.

And you’ve had experience arresting people and evaluating people for being
under the influence?

Yes.

Okay. Um, we’ve talked about kind of the - the under influence aspect of the
Taser and the effects on it. Does mental health in your experience also, uh,
play a factor in the effectiveness of the Taser?

Yes, um, i- it depends those on individual’s - when you’re, you know, when in
CIT training they kinda teach you to look for certain things. You know, and,
but it just depends on the individual. Um, the fact that he was not talking, he
was unresponsive but willing to fight. Uh, the strength, all that stuff led me to
believe he’s probably just under the influence of some type of PCP or drug.
“Cause normally people with mental health - like, if we rewind and go back to
the earlier in the day when I told you about the black female we contacted...

yeah.
..She clearly had obviously mental health issues. But, she was coherent and
she was able to talk and answer questions - she just didn’t like it. So, you
know, and then we fast forward to somebody under the influence, all he
wanted to do was fight.
Okay. All right, I think that (unintelligible).
I just have a few final questions for the record.

Okay.

Um, so, e- we’ve made reference to the MAV or the Mobile Audio Video
system, right?

Yes.
And you had that running in patrol car at the time?
Yes.

And you also mentioned that you had a, um, an audio mic attached to your,

Yes.

But prior to this interview you have not reviewed any sort of audio or video
you took at the scene, right?

=) 400 COUNTY CENTER, 3RD FLOOR REDWOOD CITY, CA 94063 650-363-4636
SUPPLEMENT 10 - Interview of Deputy Bryan Watt

Investigation:
On October 3, 2018, I was assigned as the primary investigator for the San Mateo County District

Attorney’s Office investigation into an Officer Involved Critical Incident (OICI) which occurred on that
date involving deputies from the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

On October 5, 2018, I conducted an interview with Deputy Bryan Watt of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office. Deputy Watt was one of five (5) deputies who were involved in a use of force incident
which included the deployment of a Taser and the use of pepper spray. The subject of the use of force,
deceased subject Chinedu Okobi, was later pronounced deceased at Mills-Peninsula Hospital. This
incident occurred in the 1400 block of El Camino Real in the City of Millbrae. The interview was
conducted at the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office and was documented through both audio
and video recording. Also present during the interview was Attorney Gregory Thoming of Mastagni
Holstedt, APC. During the interview, I confirmed with Deputy Watt he was providing a voluntary
statement to the District Attorney’s Office and he had not been ordered to provide a statement by any
members of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

Prior to the beginning of the interview, Senior Inspector Massey met with Gregory Thoming who
advised us Deputy Watt was requesting to view his Mobile Audio Video (MAV) footage and any
civilian video footage prior to providing a voluntary statement in this matter (see Senior Inspector
Massey’s supplemental report for further details). Thoming reviewed all of the available MAV footage
and civilian video footage at the District Attorney’s Office prior to meeting with Deputy Watt. Thoming
then reviewed Deputy Watt’s MAV footage and the available civilian video footage at the District
Attorney’s Office with Deputy Watt prior to the interview. During the Interview, I confirmed with
Deputy Watt that he had only viewed these two videos prior to our interview.

Interview with Deputy Bryan Watt (paraphrased and not verbatim):
Deputy Watt stated he has worked for the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office for “a little over twenty-

three (23) years”. Deputy Watt began his career at the Sheriff's Office as a Correctional Officer and
served in that capacity for approximately five (5) years before being promoted to the position of Deputy
Sheriff in December of 2000. Deputy Watt stated he had no prior law enforcement or military
background prior to being employed by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. As a member of the San
Mateo County Sheriff’s Office, Deputy Watt stated he has been assigned primarily to the San Mateo
County Jail and to the Sheriff's Office Patrol Bureau, though he has worked some shifts in the Courts
and Transportation Division in the past when they have been short-staffed. Deputy Watt said he is
currently assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau.

I asked Deputy Watt to describe the items he typically wears on his duty belt as well as items on his
external ballistic vest carrier. Deputy Watt started he is right handed and carries his duty firearm on his
right hip and keeps a secondary, or back-up firearm in a pouch on the right front side of his external vest
carrier. Deputy Watt stated he carries both pepper spray and an ASP (collapsible baton) on the left front
side of the outer carrier and a pouch with additional magazines for his duty firearm in the center of the

vest. Deputy Watt stated he also carriers a tourniquet, a pouch contaiming latex gloves, one (1) set of
handcuffs and his police radio on his vest carrier. Deputy Watt stated his Taser is on the left side of his
duty belt, opposite of his firearm, and he carries a second set of handcuffs on his duty belt positioned to
the rear of his firearm.

Deputy Watt stated October 3, 2018 was his normal, scheduled work shift and his assignment was day
shift, working a twelve (12) hour shift from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Deputy Watt explained he works a
rotating schedule and does not have fixed days off. Deputy Watt told me his shift on October 3, 2018
had been his first shift of the work week. Deputy Watt informed me he had worked overtime shifts on
both October 1, 2018 and October 2, 2018 and both shifts were during daytime hours. Deputy Watt
described his normal assigned beat as including all the unincorporated areas in the northern part of the
county from highway 92, north to the San Francisco border. He clarified that his beat excludes the
physical city limits within Millbrae, which is a separate beat assignment.

For his shift on October 3, 2018, Deputy Watt stated he was driving his normal assigned vehicle. Deputy
Watt described his patrol vehicle as a white Ford Explorer with a blue stripe and Sheriff's Office logos
on the vehicle. Deputy Watt stated the vehicle is San Mateo County Sheriff's Office vehicle 37 and is
equipped with Mobile Audio Video (MAV); however, the body-worn microphone for the vehicle was
missing when he showed up for work that morning. Deputy Watt said he made Sergeant Weidner aware
of the fact that the microphone was missing from the vehicle. Deputy Watt said he believed Sergeant
Weidner had sent out an Email asking to have the microphone replaced once Deputy Watt informed him
it was missing. Deputy Watt stated he was wearing a full wool police uniform with Sheriff's Office
patches on the shoulders. Deputy Watt stated he was wearing a ballistic vest carrier outside of his
uniform. Deputy Watt said his badge and name tag were affixed to the front of his external vest carrier,
which he described as a metal badge and name tag rather than the embroidered type. Deputy Watt was
assigned as the sole officer in his patrol vehicle as is standard for patrol within the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office. Deputy Watt identified Sergeant David Weidner as his direct supervisor for his shift on
October 3, 2018 and confirmed Sergeant Weidner is his normal assigned supervisor.

I asked Deputy Watt if he received a full night’s sleep prior to beginning his shift on October 3, 2018.
Deputy Watt said he typically goes to sleep at approximately 10:30 PM to 11:0 PM and wakes up by
approximately 3:00 Am to 3:15 AM on the mornings he works and confirmed this was what he did in
his sleep cycle before starting his shift on October 3, 2018. Deputy Watt said his normal routine
includes going to the gym each morning to work out from approximately 4:00 AM to 5:00 AM and then
he reports directly to the Millbrae substation where he showers and gets ready for his shift. Deputy Watt
stated he was not under the weather or taking any medications on October 3, 2018. I asked Deputy Watt
if he took any prescription medications which might affect his reaction times or impair his abilities in
any way and he stated he did not take any such medications. Deputy Watt described his off hours after
his shift on October 2, 2018 as consisting of having gone home, watched television and ate dinner.
Deputy Watt stated he did consume one (1) beer after getting off work on October 2, 2108.

SUPPLEMENT 10 - Interview of Deputy Bryan Watt

Deputy Watt discussed his activity earlier in his shift on October 3, 2018. Deputy Watt said the deputy
assigned to the Millbrae beat for the shift was Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti and explained she was in a
training at the beginning of the shift so he was covering the Millbrae beat during the first several hours
of his shift. Deputy Watt described a call for service in Millbrae at around 8:00 AM in which he was
dispatched to a report of a suspicious person walking on El Camino Real. Deputy Watt said the subject
was a transient female and it was ultimately determined she had just been released from Mills-Peninsula
Hospital. Deputy Watt stated due to the subject’s demeanor initially, she was placed in handcuffs;
however, she was ultimately released without incident. I asked Deputy Watt to better describe the
subject’s demeanor and he said the subject was agitated and refused to stop. Deputy Watt said Deputy
Wang and Deputy Sanders were on scene ahead of him and were in the process of handcuffing the
subject when he arrived. Deputy Watt described the female as being mentally ill, but not to the point of
needing to be committed at the time and stated she was yelling and her pants had had fallen to the
ground when he arrived. Deputy Watt said he talked with her and was able to calm her down while he
was on-scene and learned she had discharge paperwork in her possession showing she had been released
from the hospital that morning.

Deputy Watt said he next attempted to contact a subject who was smoking on the platform at the BART
Station. Deputy Watt said the subject walked away from him and then pushed a bicycle at him while
they both rode up on an escalator within the station. Deputy Watt said the subject had positioned the
bicycle between them while going up the escalator and Deputy Watt said he grabbed the bicycle, at
which time the subject let it go causing it to come down on Deputy Watt but did not knock him down.
Deputy Watt said he pushed the bicycle out of his way and was able to grab the subject to place him in a
control hold. Deputy Watt said once he grabbed the subject, the subject immediately complied and sat
down. Deputy Watt said the subject was then found to have numerous warrants for his arrest out of
multiple jurisdictions and was placed under arrest without any further incident. Deputy Watt described
the rest of his shift as consisting of a “few traffic stops” after the incident at the BART station and prior
to the incident on the 1400 block of El Camino Real. Deputy Watt said a driver in one of these stops did
refuse to sign the traffic citation which required him to call Sergeant Weidner. Deputy Watt said
Sergeant Weidner responded and convinced the subject to sign the ticket without incident.

I asked Deputy Watt to walk me through the incident which occurred in the 1400 block of El Camino
Real on October 3, 2018. I asked Deputy Watt to start with the point he first became aware of the radio
traffic up to the point he was relieved at the scene. Deputy Watt told me he was at the Millbrae Police
Substation and was on the phone doing follow-up work on an unrelated case. Deputy Watt said he had
seen Deputy Wang leave the substation but did not hear any call for service coming out. Deputy Watt
said he was just finishing up his phone call when he heard Deputy Wang asking for another unit. Deputy
Watt said Deputy Lorenzatti got up to leave the substation to cover Deputy Wang and then he heard
Deputy Wang broadcast again asking for “code 3 cover”. Deputy Watt said he was the last of the
deputies to leave the report writing room at the substation and he responded to his patrol vehicle and

responded, “code three” (lights and sirens activated) to Deputy Wang’s location.

Deputy Watt said as he arrived in the area, he saw “at least two (2), if not three (3)” marked patrol
vehicles in the southbound lanes of traffic on El Camino Real in front of a bank. Deputy Watt said he
pulled his patrol vehicle along-side one of the patrol vehicles and behind another patrol vehicle. Deputy
Watt said he exited his patrol vehicle and saw a deputy who he could not identify in what he described
as the number 3 lane of traffic on El] Camino Real. Deputy Watt said he also saw the subject in the same
lane of traffic. Deputy Watt said as he came up, he realized the subject had already been “tased” because
he could see the probe wires connecting from the subject to Deputy Wang’s Taser. Deputy Watt said the
subject was on the ground, laying on his back and he could hear Deputy Lorenzatti and Sergeant
Weidner trying to convince the subject to roll over on his stomach. Deputy Watt said he saw
“somebody” try to grab the subject’s hand, but the subject pulled his hand away. Deputy Watt said he
noted one (1) prong from a Taser in the back of what he believed was the subject’s left hand; however,
said he was unsure exactly which hand the probe was in.

Deputy Watt described the subject as not physically resisting while he was on the ground, but was also
not complying with the verbal commands which were being given to him. Deputy Watt said he believed
he and the other deputies on-scene would be attempting to put handcuffs on the subject so he pulled
gloves out and was putting them on. While he was putting the gloves on, Deputy Watt said the subject
was “becoming more and more agitated” and started “rolling around”. Deputy Watt said he reached out
to try and grab ahold of the subject’s hand, but the subject kept pulling his hand away. Deputy Watt said
the subject then got back up on his feet at which time, Deputy Watt said he drew his ASP and extended
it, but did not strike the subject with it. Deputy Watt recalled another deputy (he could not recall which
one) then tried again to grab the subject, but described the subject as having “flailed away” from the
deputy. Deputy Watt then described the subject as moving south-east across the lanes of traffic into the
northbound lanes and said he was attempting to parallel the subject as he moved locations. Deputy Watt
did recall Deputy Wang deploying another Taser activation which took the subject to the ground at one
point prior to them moving across the street. Deputy Watt said the activation seemed to only be effective
for a “second or two” and described the subject as having been “able to fight through that”.

Deputy Watt said once they were in the northbound traffic lanes, Deputy Wang approached the subject
again and appeared to be trying to subdue the subject. Deputy Watt said the subject appeared to be trying
to tackle Deputy Wang and he saw the subject had his hands around Deputy Wang’s waist. Deputy Watt
said he was “pretty sure” Deputy Wang struck the subject at least once with his baton at that point in
time and Deputy Wang appeared to have been able to break free of the subject’s hold. Deputy Watt said
Deputy DeMartini was then able to tackle the subject and take him to the ground. Deputy Watt said he
and the other deputies on scene converged on the subject and each tried to get ahold of different body
parts to get him under control and place him in handcuffs. Deputy Watt described the subject as “flailing
around” and said the subject was able to turn over nearly back to being on his back again during the
struggle. Deputy Watt said the subject was on his side when “somebody deployed OC and I took a shot

of it right in the face from about a foot away”. Deputy Watt said had to back away from the attempts to
get the subject under control once he was hit with the pepper spray because he was unable to see. Deputy
Watt explained that a Millbrae City Worker then arrived on scene and assisted him in flushing his eyes
with water. Deputy Watt said this enabled him to try and assist in getting the subject under control.
Deputy Watt recalled giving “somebody” his handcuffs and then recalled the subject being handcuffed
with two (2) sets of handcuffs and being turned on his side. Deputy Watt said he then assisted in getting
the subject up into a seated position and using his leg as a chair back to help the subject sit up. Deputy
Watt said he stayed in that position assisting the subject in sitting up for approximately “a minute or
two” until he was relieved by another deputy. Deputy Watt said he then went back to getting water to
flush his eyes out and was away from the subject’s location.

Iasked Deputy Watt if he ever heard a broadcast providing a description of the subject when he was first
arriving to cover Deputy Wang. Deputy Watt said he did not recall ever hearing any description being
given of the subject prior to his arrival on-scene. Deputy Watt said the very first tume he saw the subject,
the subject was already on the ground. Deputy Watt said he determined this was the subject because he
was on the ground with Taser probes sticking out of him. Deputy Watt said he had no information as to
why the subject was being detained at that point in time. Deputy Watt said his goal was to assist his
partners in getting a subject in-custody who had been struck with a Taser. Deputy Watt said he did try to
verbally engage the subject upon arrival, including telling the subject to “roll over on his stomach” and
telling the subject he would be “tased again” if he did not “lay on his stomach”.

I asked Deputy Watt to describe to me any observation he may have had regarding the subject. Deputy
Watt described the subject as “a big person” and estimated the subject was approximately six foot to six
foot three inches in height and weighed “at least three hundred pounds”. Deputy Watt recalled the
subject was yelling, but the only words he could recall the subject saying was something similar to “get
them off me” or “get them out of me” and believed the subject was talking about the Taser prongs.
Deputy Watt also recalled the subject as “growling and grunting” during the incident as well. Deputy
Watt said he first believed the subject was possibly “5150”, but after observing the subject’s strength
and the way he was fighting off the attempts to get him under control, Deputy Watt said he then believed
the subject was under the influence of a controlled substance. I asked Deputy Watt if he had prior
experience and training in recognizing symptoms of controlled substance influence and he stated he had
been to a three (3) day school put on by the San Mateo County Narcotics Task Force and also had twenty
(20) years of experience dealing with persons under the influence of controlled substances. I asked
Deputy Watt if he had ever seen this subject previously and Deputy Watt said he did not believe he had
ever seen the subject before.

I asked Deputy Watt if he could see what the subject was grabbing when he was trying to tackle Deputy
Wang. Deputy Watt said he could see the subject had his hands near Deputy Wang’s gun belt, but could
not see what, if anything the subject had ahold of at the time. I asked Deputy Watt about his previous
statement about Deputy Wang possibly striking the subject with the ASP. Deputy Watt said he saw

SUPPLEMENT 10 - Interview of Deputy Bryan Watt

Deputy Wang swing the ASP, but could not say if the subject was struck or not. I asked Deputy Watt if
he ever saw the subject strike Deputy Wang. Deputy Watt said that shortly after the subject had grabbed
Deputy Wang’s waist area and Deputy Wang had been able to get free, he did see the subject throwing
punches “in about the face” of Deputy Wang, but could not see if these punches connected or not.
Deputy Watt said he did look away “a couple of times” as he was concerned about maintaining their
safety with on-coming vehicular traffic in the roadway. I asked Deputy Watt about Community Service
Officer Joey Gonzales’ presence during the incident. Deputy Watt did recall seemg CSO Gonzales there
at the end of the struggle and recalled CSO Gonzales attempting to assist them in getting the subject
handcuffed. Deputy Watt said he grabbed CSO Gonzales and pulled him away from the struggle and told
him to get back. Deputy Watt said he was then struck with the pepper spray (OC) around the time he
pulled CSO Gonzales away from the attempts to get the subject under control.

I asked Deputy Watt about when he was helping the subject in a seated position and asked if he heard
the subject saying anything at the time. Deputy Watt said he recalled the subject had his head down and
was unsure if the subject was breathing because he was no longer moving around as he would have
expected the subject to act after a struggle. Deputy Watt said he tried to check the subject for a pulse at
the subject’s neck and the subject suddenly brought his head up and was looking around and he could
see he was breathing so he stopped trying to find a pulse. Deputy Watt said he was talking to the subject,
telling him to relax and to breath but did not recall the subject ever saying anything in response. Deputy
Watt said once he was relieved from holding the subject up, he went up to the area in front of CSO
Gonzales’ truck and got more water to rinse his face. Deputy Watt said he did see paramedics arrive and
saw them treating the subject at one point and then looked over again at another point a short time later
and saw the paramedics were giving the subject CPR. Deputy Watt added that when he was relieved by
the deputy, he believed the relieving deputy used the same technique of propping the subject up in a
seated position using a knee to hold him up. Deputy Watt said he believed it was one of the deputies
from the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Transit Bureau who relived him, but he could not recall
which Deputy it was.

I asked Deputy Watt whether he wore any corrective lenses and Deputy Watt said he did not. Deputy
Watt said the lighting conditions were good due to it being daylight hours at the time the incident took
place and that until his being struck in the face with pepper spray, he had an unobstructed view of what
was occurring during the incident. Deputy Watt did say there were times when he would focus his
attention on passing vehicles or times when one of the other deputies might block his vision briefly
during the struggle to control the subject, but nothing else effected his ability to see what was occurring.
I asked Deputy Watt which portion of the body he was attempting to control during the final portion of
the struggle and Deputy Watt said he was trying to control one of the subject’s arms. Deputy Watt said
Deputy Wang was at an area near one of the subject’s shoulders, Sergeant Weidner was at the subject’s
waistline area, Deputy Lorenzatti was near the waistline or upper leg area of the subject and Deputy
DeMartini was at the subject’s feet. Deputy Watt said he believed he took the brunt of the pepper spray,
but thought Deputy Lorenzatti and Sergeant Weidner were also struck with the pepper spray and were

affected by it.

I asked Deputy Watt if any other less-lethal weapons or control techniques were deployed on the subject
once he was on the ground the final time in the northern lanes of traffic. Deputy Watt said he believed
the subject was only shocked with the Taser two (2) times toward the beginning of the altercation when
they were in the southbound lanes of traffic. Deputy Watt said he believed Deputy Wang struck the
subject at least once in the lower extremities with the ASP while they both were still standing upright.
Deputy Watt said the only other attempt he was aware of was the deployment of the pepper spray. I
asked him whether there were ever any attempts by any of the deputies present to apply the carotid or
vascular neck restrain (VNR) on the subject. Deputy Watt stated there was no attempt to utilize the
carotid or vascular neck restrain (VNR) on the subject. Deputy Watt said he did not sustain any injuries
during the incident other than the effects of the pepper spray.

Deputy Watt said he has been certified in Crisis Intervention Training (CIT), having attended the course
in approximately 2009. Deputy Watt said he has used the techniques from CIT training effectively in his
career since attending the course, but did not feel there was any opportunity to employ those techniques
in this incident by the time he arrived on scene. I asked Deputy Watt to explain why he felt the
techniques would not have worked and Deputy Watt told me due to the fact the subject was already
actively in a fight, had been tased and was either “not listening, not hearing or didn’t want to talk” all
were factors as to why he did not believe the techniques learned in CIT training would have worked in
this situation. Deputy Watt indicated he has had defensive tactics training and maintains those skills by
attending regular, required training put on by the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office and has maintained
other perishable skills as mandated by the California Commission on Police Officer Standards and
Training (POST). Deputy Watt said in addition to his assignment as a patrol deputy, he is also a Field
Training Officer (FTO) for the Sheriff's Office.

I asked Deputy Watt to describe some of the emotions or concerns he felt during the incident. Deputy
Watt said he was concerned with the safety of himself and the other deputies, the safety of the public and
on the safety of the subject they were attempting to detain. Deputy Watt said in his past experience,
typically once subjects are placed in handcuffs they tend to calm down and be more compliant. I asked
Deputy Watt if he felt this was a situation where he and the other deputies could have simply backed
away and left the subject alone. Deputy Watt stated he did not believe this was a situation where that
was an option and cited the fact the subject physically assaulted a deputy at one point and the fact there
were pedestrians on the roadway. Deputy Watt added that the subject already expressed a willingness to
fight with police officers, which made him unsafe to be in the general public in his opinion.

I resumed the interview after a short break and asked Deputy Watt some additional clarifying questions.
I asked Deputy Watt a series of questions regarding whether he felt he and the other deputies could have
“backed away” from the incident and just allowed the subject to walk away. I specifically asked Deputy
Watt if he could have “backed away” when he first arrived on-scene. Deputy Watt said he could not

SUPPLEMENT 10 - Interview of Deputy Bryan Watt

have “backed away” as the subject had already been “tased” and had the Taser probes still in him and
added that the Sheriffs Office policy required them to get medical help for the subject once the Taser
had been used. I asked him about the assault on the officer, something he mentioned previously as a
reason for why the subject could not be allowed to walk away. Deputy Watt was able to confirm he was
talking about the assault on Deputy Wang. He described the assault on Deputy Wang as occurring later
in the incident, closer to the point when the subject was ultimately taken under control and placed in
handcuffs. I asked Deputy Watt to better explain what he observed upon first arriving at the scene.
Deputy Watt said when he first arrived, he could only see the other stopped patrol vehicles and assumed
his fellow deputies were in front of the patrol vehicles. Deputy Watt said he then saw the back of one of
the deputies (he could not be sure as to which one) in front of the vehicles as he exited his own patrol
vehicle. Deputy Watt said that as he exited his vehicle and began heading toward the location of the
patrol vehicles, he saw deputies moving from the area of the street nearest the sidewalk toward the lanes
of traffic. Deputy Watt said he only saw other deputies at that point and the first time he came into view
of the subject, the subject was already lying on his back on the ground. Deputy Watt said he could see
the wires coming out of the Taser and immediately assumed the Taser had been deployed at the subject.
Deputy Watt said he then saw the one (1) probe from the Taser in the back of one of the subject’s hands.
Deputy Watt said he never saw where the second probe struck the subject. Deputy Watt said he did not
initially hear any noise from the Taser, but believed he may have heard the noise from the second
activation of the Taser, indicated by the subject falling to the ground as second time.

I specifically asked Deputy Watt if he ever used his own ASP, Taser or pepper spray on the subject.
Deputy Watt stated he did not ever use any of those items. He clarified, that he had drawn his ASP, and
extended it, but he did not strike the subject with it at any time. Deputy Watt also denied ever striking or
hitting the subject and stated his only contact with the subject was his attempts to physically restrain
him. I asked Deputy Watt if, when the subject was on the ground the final time, whether he observed if
the Taser probes were still in the subject. Deputy Watt said he did not notice if the probes were still in
the subject or not.

At the culmination, I allowed Gregory Thoming to ask any clarifying questions he might have for
Deputy Watt. Thoming asked Deputy Watt if, based upon his twenty-three (23) years with the Sheriffs
Office, if Deputy Watt did anything outside of policy or what he has been trained to do. Deputy Watt
stated “no”. Thoming asked Deputy Watt if he observed his fellow deputies do anything “like that” and
Deputy Watt stated “no”. Thoming also confirmed with Deputy Watt that he had spoken with the subject
during this incident and had made attempts to calm the subject and gain his compliance. Thoming asked
Deputy Watt if he ever heard other deputies attempting to speak with the subject and calm him and gain
his cooperation. Deputy Watt stated “yes”.

And, uh, you would’ve gotten up at 3:15 approximately in the morning?

Yeah, I would’ve. I got up at 3:15, yes.

Okay. What time do you get to, um, wherever you - do you report directly to
Millbrae?

Yeah, I - my - kinda my morning entails me going to the gym. I usually get to
the gym around a little after 4:00. Work out ‘til about 5:00 and then I get to
Millbrae about 5:00 where I take a shower and get ready for work.

Okay. And, um, how were you feeling that day? No illnesses or under the
weather or anything?

No.
Okay. And were you taking any medications or anything?

your reaction times?
No.

Um, while you were off between your last day of overtime on transportation
and your Millbrae shift did you do anything eventful during your time off?

No, I went home. Probably had dinner and watched TV and then went to bed.
Did you have anything to drink that night?

Uh, no.

Okay.

I mean did...water.

Yeah, no - no alcohol.

Yeah, no.

Okay.

You know I take that back. I did have a beer when I got home.

Um, yeah, um, we had a - we had a - the normal - the Millbrae cover deputy,
which would’ve been Deputy Lorenzatti, she had training ‘til noon so I was
kinda in Millbrae covering her spot ‘til about noon.

Okay.

Un, at around - I forget the exact time - about 8:00ish in the morning, uh, we
got a call of a suspicious person walking down El Camino. Um, turned out it
was a - it was a transient that had got released out of the hospital and, uh, we
ended up putting her in handcuffs for a minute just due to her demeanor at the
time. Uh, once we - everything was fine she got released and got back on the
BART or went back towards BART. Um, shortly after that, um, I observed a
subject at the Cal Train Station that was smoking on the platform which is
against the law. Um, I approached him. Um, during the time when I was tyrin’
to identify myself, um, he tried to walk away from me. Um, we ended up, uh,
goin’ up the escalator where he pushed a bicycle at me. Um, I ended up havin’
to put him into a control hold and wait for cover to be before I put him in
handcuffs. Turned out he had a couple warrants and ended up going to jail for
- for resisting arrest and the warrants. Um, and then, um, forget what I did.
Two other traffic stops and then, uh...

And those traffic stops were normal routine...

Yeah, um, well one of ‘em refu-, refused to sign the ticket so I had to call my
sergeant out, um...

And that’s Sergeant Weidner?

Sergeant Weidner, right. Ended up talking him into signing the ticket. Um, so
that was a little, uh, not as normal as a normal traffic stop but...

Okay.

...other than him just not wantin’ to sign the ticket. There was no - no other
issues with that.

Okay. And what was your call sign that day?
I was 2 Boy 60.
Okay. And that corresponds with the beat that you were assigned?

The 60 beat?
The 60 beat, correct.

Okay. Um, goin’ backwards a little bit to the two contacts that you had with
the...

Uh-huh.

...transient female.

Right.

Um, you talked about her demeanor. What was it about her demeanor?

Um, I - I got there third, um, and as I was getting there she was agitated,
refused to stop. Um, at that time Deputy Wang and Deputy Saunders were in
the process of putting her in handcuffs. Um, she was yellin’. Her pants
weren’t necessarily around her waist. They had fallen down to the ground.
Um, we sat her down. I started talkin’ with her and she calmed down and
turns out she was maybe a little bit 5150 not to the point where she had to go
to the hospital but...

And you mentioned that she had been released from.

She had been released from a hospital, um, that morning at some point. I don’t
remember - I don’t know the time but that morning she had paperwork to...

From Peninsula?

From Peninsula Hospital...

Okay.

..Saying she had got released.

Um, do you know if that was on a 5150 hold that she’d been there on?
I don’t know. I don’t know.

Sorry.

..kinda pulling away from you. There’s flies that come through here so...
That’s okay.

Um, I’m tryin’ to get rid of them. Um, you kinda went over when he went up
the escalator you went up the escalator. You said we. Is that - was it just the
two of you at that point?

Just me and him at the time.

Okay. And he pushed a bike at you? Threw a bike at you?

Yeah he - he didn’t throw it. We were goin’ up the escalator and, um, as I
grabbed his - he had positioned a bike in between us.

And did he - was the bike his?
The bike was one of those rent - rental bikes.
Okay.

Uh, I think it was a Ford Rental Bike or whatever they call ‘em. One of the
city kinda app bikes.

Okay.

Um, he had that positioned in between us and - and he wasn’t running. He
wasn’t being aggressive or anything. Just basically saying, “I’m leaving.” Um,
I grabbed a hold of the bike and he sort of let it go meaning since I was below
him it kinda came down on me. I was able to push it out of the way relatively
easy and went up and I grabbed him. When I grabbed him he sat back down.

He just kinda sat on the floor. When we got to the top I kept a hold of him
until my cover unit got there and then we put him in handcuffs.

So you were able to get him in a control hold?
Yeah.
An upward position. You didn’t have to...

Um, he was - well he was seated. He had sat himself onto one of the steps...

Okay.

As we got to the top - I basically told him on the way up I said, “As soon as
we get up top you’re gonna lay on your belly.” And - and he did kinda on his
side more for his belly and I just held him in that position until my cover unit
got there and we were able to put him in handcuffs.

So resistant in the form of not tryin’ to stay with you and...

Right. Not fighting or anything like that but just not wanting to stay and let me
either issue him a ticket or figure out what was goin’ on.

Okay. Um, okay. Well that brings us up to now the incident that has us here
today.

Right.

My understanding it was about | o’clock. Um, what I’m gonna ask you to do
is just essentially tell me the story, start to beginning from the time that you
first hear something going on on the radio...

Okay.

...to kinda the point that you are essentially relieved or kind of extracted from
being involved in it.

Sure. Um, I was at the substation. Um, in fact we - the whole shift was at the
substation. We had just finished eatin’ lunch. It was right around 1:00. I don’t
know - remember the exact time. I was on the phone doing some follow-up on
another case. Um, I saw Deputy Wang leave the substation. Um, I didn’t hear
the call come out on the radio. Um, as I was getting off my phone call, um, I
heard him ask for another unit. Um, at that point Deputy Lorenzatti got up and
started to leave, which was his partner at the time. Um, within a - probably a
few seconds at that point I heard him ask for code three cover. At that point I
left the - I was the last person out of - out of the report writing room which is
where we were all at at the time. Got in my car. Responded to his location
code three. Um, basically took El Camino from the substation to where he was
at. Um, as I came into view of the incident I saw at least two if not three patrol
cars over in the southbound lanes of El Camino Real almost right in front of
the bank right there. ’m drawin’ a blank on the name of the bank but it used
to be the first something or other. Forgot the name of the bank but there’s a
bank right there. Um, I came across the lanes. Pulled my patrol car in next to
one patrol car and then be - behind a third patrol car. Um, as I exited my
patrol car, um, I proceed - I - I saw a Sheriffs Office deputy, and I don’t
remember who it was, just the back of it, and then the suspect had came and

was basically in the number three lane of El Camino Real. Um, that point I
came up and I realized that he had been Tased. Um, I saw the - the - the cords
coming out from him leading to Deputy Wang’s Taser.

Was he on the ground or was he...

He was on the ground on his back at that point. Um, Deputy Lorenzatti and it
was Sergeant Weidner were tryin’ to convince him to - to roll onto his
stomach. Um, one point, um, I saw somebody try to grab his hand and he
flailed his hand away not lettin’ ‘em grab his hand. Um, when I got into view
of him I was kinda concentrating on his - I believe it was his left hand but I
could be wrong on the hand. But um, it had a prong - prong stuck into his - the
- the top of his hand. Um, I don’t recall what side it was on his hand.

Okay.

Um, I saw it had some blood comin’ out of it. Um, he was on the ground and
at that point and wasn’t physically resisting but wasn’t complying either. He
wasn’t rolling over. Um, I - I - at that point I put gloves on. Um, ‘cause I had a
feelin’ we were gonna put him in handcuffs. Um, as I was getting gloves on
he started becoming more and more agitated. He started yelling. Um, tried to
get a hold of his hand a couple times in order to see if I can turn him over and
put him in handcuffs and he kept pullin’ his hand away from me. Um, during
that whole process he had started getting back onto his feet. Uh, as he got onto
his feet I stepped back a little bit. I did deploy my ASP, um, to the open
position. Um, somebody tried to grab him and he flailed away from that
person, that deputy. I don’t remember who it was. Um, he kinda broke free of
that. He - he saw me and he started to work his way - woulda been south in
direction and also across El Camino Real, kinda away from me at that point
and I tried to parallel him.

One thing I should ask and pause you for just a second. I’m sorry to interrupt
your train of thought.

No worries.

But I probably should have addressed before. I - this is my fault. But you did
watch some video...

Uh-huh.
..of this incident and what videos did you watch?

I watched my dash cam video from my police car.

Okay.

Um, and then I watched I believe it was a cell phone video from somebody
that was in the bank.

Okay. And what I’m gonna ask you to do too as you're telling the story is if
it’s something that you remember, you know, physically remember from not
watching the videos to tell me or just to go ahead and keep telling me the
story. But if it’s something that you only remember because you saw it on the
video please tell me that that’s where you know it from as we go.

Okay. Um, basically I re-, everything I saw on the video was stuff that I
remembered...

Okay.

.already. I didn’t...

But just if anything comes out that you...

Okay.

..go ahead and remember that but I saw it in the video and this is what I saw.
Absolutely.

Just - just so we can kinda differentiate.

Okay. Okay. Um, and like I said I saw him started to work, um, his way sorta
like southeast I would get to say across lanes of El Camino. Um, I kinda
paralleled him, keepin’ him from running in my direction. As we got into the
northbound lanes of, uh, El Camino Real, I believe it was the middle lane, um,
at that point, uh, I think it was Deputy Wang, um, tried to approach him again
to take him to the ground. Oh, let me back up. Um, in between that process at
some point, um, I believe Deputy Wang, um, gave him another, uh, forget the
technical term, but another - another - not a Taser deployment meaning the
full shot but another shock from the initial...

Another activation.

Another activation. That’s the word I’m looking for. Sorry. Um, gave another
activation. Um, that did bring him to the ground but only for a brief second or
two and then he was able to fight through that and stand back up. At that -

that’s about the time I deployed my ASP. Um, deployed it meaning extending
it and having it in my hand. Um, and that’s when he started running across El

Camino or moving across El Camino. Um, we kinda followed him. As we got
to the - the northbound lanes of El Camino Real, I believe it was the number
two lane about, um, Deputy Wang had approached him again and tried to take
him down. Um, at that point he appeared to be tryin’ to tackle Deputy Wang
like grabbing him around the waist. Um, Deputy Wang I’m pretty sure struck
him at least once with his baton. Um, kinda broke free of that. He then turned
and started going kind of in a southeasterly direction again, um, until Deputy
DeMartini tackled him basically from the side or the back which caused him
to fall to the ground. At that point, um, we kinda all converged on him and,
uh, tried to take - take pieces of him, you know, his hands and his feet and
stuff like that in to control so we can put him in handcuffs. Um, he was
flailing around. At one point he got almost back to his back - onto his back
again. Um, he was on side. Um, that point somebody deployed OC and I took
a shot of it right - right - right in the face from about probably less than a foot
away. Um, I couldn’t see at that point. Uh, not wanting to grab another deputy
or anything else I backed - pulled myself outta the - outta the tussle for him.
Um, a passerby - it was actually a public works guy that happened to be on the
roadway gave me a bottle of water. I put some water - put some water on my -
on my eyes. Um, by that point I kinda got back - went back over to them. We
had sort of controlled his hand by that point where they were placing him in
handcuffs. Um, I did give somebody my handcuffs. Um, next thing I
remember is he was handcuffed with two pairs of handcuffs, um, and he was
kinda on his side. Um, | assisted in sitting him into a - to a upright position, to
a sitting position, um, using my leg as kinda like a chair back. I kinda kept
him up in the sitting position, um, for a minute - minute or so until I was
relieved by incoming units that were coming and at that point I kinda backed
away from him and got some more water and was tryin’ to flush my eyes out.

Okay. I’m gonna go back to just some things in there.

Uh-huh.

Could be something that you said that I may have missed at the time so I may
end up asking you to repeat something that I might have missed. Um, in your
responding to the scene did you ever hear a description of the person being put
out?

Not that I recall.

When you did arrive on scene there were already at least a few deputies
present.

At least three if not four, yeah.

Correct.

.. with this person? He was already on the ground at that point in time or...
Um, when I first saw him he was on the ground.

Okay.

Um, whether he was there when I first pulled up or not I’m not sure.

Is that how you were able to identify who...

Yeah, he was the person on the ground with the Taser probes comin’ out of
him.

Okay. And you didn’t know - or did you know anything about why he was
being detained or what the situation was?

I - [had - no I did not. Not ‘til after the fact.
Okay. And as you got there to assist what were you trying to accomplish?

When I got there I was tryin’ to take him into custody. Um, I mean obviously
there was something going on with him and my partners, um, to the point
where they Tased him. Um, I - I was tryin’ to verbally talk to him. I tried to
verbally talk to him a couple times. Told him to just - just to lay on his, you
know, to lay on his stomach. Um, you know, you’re gonna get Tased again, I
think I told him if you don’t lay on your stomach. Um, I tried to grab his hand
a couple times, um, just to put ‘em behind his back as we’re trained and put
him in handcuffs.

All right. Um, tell me about what you saw with this guy. What did he - kinda
what’d he look like, um...

He was a big person. Um, guessing he was 6’ to 63”. Um, I’m puttin’ him at
least 300 pounds. Um, I mean he was - he was a big person.

And, um, how was he reacting? Was he saying anything? Was he...
The only thing - he was yelling. The only thing I physically remember him or
- remember him saying verbatim was - was like, “Get ‘em off me. Get ‘em off

me,” or, “Get ‘em outta me.” I believe he was talking about the Taser prongs.

That’s the only thing I remember him saying and he was growling and
grunting and that type of stuff but only words I remember hearing were - was
that.

Um, did you perceive anything about him by this behavior?

Un, at - at - at first I thought he was, uh, maybe kinda 5150, um, when I first
saw him. Um, after - as I was interacting with him more and - and just by his
strength and his - way he was fightin’ off our devices is I believe he was under

the influence of some sort of a controlled substance.

And do you have experience in identifying people under the influence of a
controlled substance?

Yeah, I’ve been to - been to the, um, the three-day school through I believe it
was our Narcotics Task Force. Um, I’ve also had 23 years of experience
dealing with people that are intoxicated.

Have you ever seen this guy before?

No, not that I remember.

Um, you described a point where he was tryin’ to grab Officer Wang...

Uh-huh.

..around the - the waist. Where did you see his hands at? What was he doin’
with his hands?

I - I didn’t - wasn’t really paying attention to his hands. I saw him lunge at
Deputy Wang and grab - he was - he was in the area of his gun belt, um, when
he tried to grab him. That’s all I remember.

Um, and I know you talked about it a little bit and I think I got sidetracked
with my train of thought about the video at this point. But you talked about
Officer Wang deploying his ASP.

Correct.

And you - you thought that he took a swing?

I thought he did as he was either coming at him or after he kinda tried to grab
on him.

Did you - but you didn’t see it connect or you’re just not sure?
I’m not sure if it connected or not.

Okay. And what did you see that happened right after that? Was there
anything?

Um...

Was that about the point that he tried to wrap him up around the waist or -
Officer Wang around the wa-, Deputy Wang around the waist?

I - I don’t remember the order to be honest with you.

Okay.

I- I - I don’t remember the order.

Did you see him physically striking Officer Wang - Deputy Wang?

Yeah he did strike him a couple times. I believe it was after he tried to grab
him around the waist, um, Deputy Wang was able to kinda fight off that part
of it and he did throw punches at him, uh, in about the face. I don’t know how
many made contact with his face or anything like that. Um, we were also
dodging cars so I was worried about cars driving down El Camino at the time
so I - I did look away a couple times to make sure I wasn’t gonna get hit by a
car.

Right. Um, during I think kinda that last point when he moved into the
northbound lanes of traffic...

Uh-huh.

...kinda towards the end point of all this. There’s a CSO truck...

Correct.

...there. Did - did you see the CSO at this point as well?

Un, the first time I remember seeing the CSO was after - after he had went to
the ground for the - for the last time before when we took him into custody.
The CSO had got out of his truck or was - was there somehow and was
actually trying to help us. Um, I did - [remember grabbin’ him and sayin’,

“Hey, get out. Get outta here.” And kinda pushed him back off. And that’s
about the time I got hit with OC.

And this is Joey Gonzales?

Correct.

Okay. And at some point obviously these - the city worker that you’ve talked
about or the public works worker was also present at least providing you
water.

Yes. Right exactly.

Did you see that they were present at some point prior to this or...

There was a work crew working on the sidewalk over in front of the bank.
Um, I can’t say if they were - I don’t remember what agency they’re from. I
don’t know if they...

Okay.

...were Public Works or if it was Cal-Trans. I saw work trucks over there
(unintelligible)...

Okay. So you don’t act-, even the person that was providing you water you’re
not sure where they were from?

Um, I know - I know he was from Public Works only ‘cause I’ve seen him
before.

Okay.
Um, but as far as the other crew I don’t remember where they were from.

Um, you talked about sitting him up, kinda holding him up with your leg at a
point.

Correct.

Was he saying anything at this point in time? How was he acting?

No, he wasn’t saying anything. In fact at - at - when I first pulled him up, um,
his head was down. I remember reachin’ in try to find a pulse, um, and he - he

came back up and pulled his head up so I knew he was still breathing. That’s
what I was concerned about when I first pulled him over. I wasn’t sure if he

had - if he was passed out or what was goin’ on ‘cause his head was not up or
flailing around like I would expect it to be after somebody that just put up a
fight like he did.

Okay.

Um, I remember tryin’ to reach in to see if I can get a pulse. Um, at that point
he lifted his head up so I - I didn’t - I stopped tryin’ to take a pulse because he
was moving his head around. Um, I don’t believe he said anything. Um, I
mean I was talkin’ to him. I was just tryin’ to tell him to relax, breathe. Um,
and - and that’s - he never said anything to me from that point on.

Was he breathing at that point in time?

He was breathing when - when I was first there when he had - had moved his
head up, yes.

Okay. So when he was sitting.

Yeah, that would’ve - yeah.

And at some point somebody relieved you?
Correct.

At that point. And did you kinda see what was going on with him after that
point or did you...

No I kinda walked away ‘cause I - like I said I took a pretty good shot of OC -
the gel OC. Um, I was - really wasn’t seein’ that well. Um, I did get some
more water and I kinda remember walkin’ around to the front of the CSO
truck and, uh, dousing more water on my - my face and stuff.

At some point in time did you see that, um, paramedics had arrived to treat
him?

I saw paramedics arrived. I saw when the fire engine pulled up. Um, I heard it
and could see that from where I was at. Um, but I did see them working on
him. Um, and then I remember looking over at some point, probably a few
minutes after that, and - and I watched as they were startin’ CPR on him.

Okay. Um, when they first arrived do you know was he still seated up at that
point or...

Yes.

He was when the firemen...

Well l-L...

As far as you know.

As far as I know. He was seated up. Uh, I - I gave - I don’t remember what - it
was a Transit deputy. I don’t remember which one that showed up. Um, there
were several of them there. I don’t remember which one took - took over for
me but he took my position. Um, I believe he used the same technique or was
at least when I walked away.

Okay. Um, talk a little bit about you again.

Uh-huh.

Um, do you wear any corrective lenses, any glasses, contact lenses or
anything like that?

No.

Okay. So you have good vision?

Um-hmm.

And the lighting conditions?

It was | o’clock daylight.

Was there anything ever kind of obscuring your visibility to this incident?
Uh, not until the point I got OC’d.

Okay. Maybe some of the bodies when they were piled on top of things? Was
it hard to see everything going on?

Yeah, I mean - yeah I mean there was cars goin’ by and you know there was
people that would step in front of me and stuff like that but...

While he was down on the ground, that’s kinda the end point...

Right, uh-huh.

..essentially. Uh, where were you tryin’ to grab?

Um, I - I was tryin’ to basically control one of his arms and how the body was
- I can tell you the direction of the body but what - if it was his right or left
arm I couldn’t tell you.

Okay.

Um, it would’ve been on the - the north - north side of how he was layin’.
And you’ve described kind of similar where everybody else was...

Right.

.. tryin’ to grab something?

Yeah, um, uh, Deputy Wang was more - I would say more at probably his -
one of his shoulders, um, across from me on the body. Uh, Sergeant Weidner
was about his waistline across from me. Um, Deputy Lorenzatti was - was
next to me probably about his waist or maybe even a leg and Deputy

DeMartini as at his feet.

Okay. Um, other than you did anybody else also get pepper sprayed that
you’re aware of?

Yeah, I - I think I took the brunt of it. I think there was some reflection off my
face that hit Deputy Lorenzatti that was sittin’ next to me and also Sergeant
Weidner I believe he said he got a little douse of it also.

You could hear them talking about this during the incident?

Right. And it was all verbally.

Yeah. Not afterwards though but this was during the incident?

Yes.

he was down on the ground as far as was he Tased again, was he - I mean you
described that he was obviously pepper sprayed at some point.

Right. Uh, um, right. Um, he - he - I - I know he was Tased at... a time before
I got there. Um, I believe he had one more activation put on him sometime
around the time he either was getting to his feet or had just gotten to his feet.
Um, I - I believe that was the last time he was, uh, the Taser was deployed on
him. Um, at least from my knowledge. Um, I know Deputy Wang struck him
at least once with a, um, a baton or an ASP. Um, it was towards the lower
extremities. Where exactly it hit I’m not sure.

And was he upright or down on the ground at that point?

He was upright at that point.

Okay.

Um, and then other than that - other than the OC when he was, uh, on the
ground that’s it.

No attempts to do like a carotid restraint or anything like that with him?
No.

Okay. That you saw?

That I saw, right. Not that I did or I saw.

Okay. Um, we talked a little bit about your vehicle being an assigned vehicle.
Is it a marked vehicle?

Yes.

Okay. Um, what type of car?

It’s an SUV... Explorer.

What color?

Uh, it’s white with a big blue stripe on it.

And it’s equipped with a MAV video?
It’s equipped with a MAV video, correct.
Um, does that have the remote microphone?

It used to. Um, it - it - I went on vacation about a week ago and it disappeared
sometime while I was on vacation.

And the remote microphone goes with the vehicle, correct?

Correct. Um, um, I believe - I did tell my sergeant about it that morning. I
waited - I was hopin’ it was gonna show back up. Um, I told my sergeant
about it that morning actually and I believe he sent an email out that morning.
Sergeant Weidner?

Weidner asking for a new one for my vehicle.

Okay.

So yes it is equipped but no I did not have it that day.

And normally you would wear that somewhere on your person?

On my body, correct.

Where would you wear that normally?

Um, my vest has two - two loops about the button line. One I carry my radio
on the other one I usually clip that on to it.

Okay. Um, other than the effects of the pepper spray was there any other
injuries that you sustained during this?

No.

Yes.

And successfully?

Yes.

Did you feel there was an opportunity to use any of those techniques during

Not by the time I got there.

And how come?

Um, he was actively fighting. He was already had been tased. Um, I mean it

No.

Okay. Um, do you have any involvement with like hostage negotiations or any
of that?

No.

Okay. Um, you talked a little bit about kind of the need to get him wrapped up
and get him into custody and some of the concerns you, yourself had about
traffic...

Right.

..coming by and stuff. Um, did you have any other concerns going on while
this was occurring, things that you were feeling, emotions that you were
feeling?

No, I was just - I was worried about getting him into custody for our safety,
for the general public’s safety and - and actually his safety. Once we get him
in the cuffs he’s - in my experience people calm down and are - are a little

more willing to, you know, think it’s over.

Okay. Um, do you think it was a situation where you could’ve backed away
and let him go?

No, I don’t. Not at - not at the point where I got there.

Can you explain a little bit of why?

Um, well he had physically attacked a deputy already. Um, there was very
busy traffic on the street. There was pedestrians on the street. Um, if he’s
willin’ to fight with the deputies he’s not safe to be in the general public in my
opinion.

Okay. We’re gonna take, uh, kind of a break for a couple minutes here...

Okay.

..[’m gonna confer with my supervisors and stuff and let you guys kinda
confer real quickly again and...

Okay.

Okay.

But I’m gonna leave the video running in here so you guys will probably want
to go outside to...

Okay.

Okay.

...to confer and I’ll just keep the door closed.

Okay.

I just have a couple of very brief things and I also wanna give your attorney a
chance to kind of clarify and ask some things if he chooses to do so as well.
Um, you talked about, um, when I asked you the question about could you just
let - back away and let him go.

Uh-huh.

Um, you talked about he had already committed an assault on an officer.
Which point are you talking about when he committed the assault on the
officer?

Um, I guess depends on when you're talking about backing away.

Right. Um, well let’s - I guess maybe we’ll break it down a little bit.

 

Uh-huh.

How about at the point that you first arrive could you have just backed away?
No because he had two Taser prongs sticking out of him and, uh, I mean he’d
al-, he’d already been Tased once so, you know, per our policy we needed to
get him medical help and everything else so...

So there would be a need to detain him...

Correct.

..at that point. And that would’ve continued as he kinda kept getting up?

Correct.

Um, and then I assume the assault on the officer that you’re talking about is
Deputy Wang?

Deputy Wang correct.
And that’s kind of at the end?

That’s kinda the end to the middle. The middle - towards - yeah, I guess it
would be more towards the end.

Where the whole thing ended...
Correct.

...that location?

Yeah.

Okay. Um, let’s go over just a little bit again of like when you first get there,
as you’re pulling up...

Uh-huh.
...what exactly do you see? What do - what is it you see?

When I first pulled up I just saw the patrol cars. I didn’t see anybody. I was -
was assuming they were in front of the patrol cars. Um, as I pulled into where
I parked I saw - I saw a deputy - uh, the back of a deputy, I believe, so I kinda
knew they were in towards the front of the patrol cars. As I got out of my
patrol and kinda worked my way in between the other cars they kinda came
into - onto El Camino or more into my view on El Camino. I don’t know if
they were...

So they were still kind of moving a little bit at that point?

They were still moving. They kinda were moving - and I don’t know if they
were on the sidewalk or not but from where the sidewalk would be into the
street.

Okay. And was everybody still kind of upright at that point?

Um, the deputies were. Um, he was on his back by the time I came into view
of him.

See him he was on his back, correct.

Um, and did you see the - the fact that the Taser wires were in him...
Yes I saw...

..by then or within seconds of that?

Within seconds. I saw the wires coming out of the Taser so I assumed that it
had been deployed and that’s - I only saw one prong but I saw the prong that
hit him on the hand and I don’t remember what hand it was. But it had stuck
right into the flat part of your hand right by your wrist.

Did you hear the - the noise from the Taser?

No.

At any point?

Um, I believe it was the second activation. I heard that one.

Which was the second time he went to the ground?

Correct.

Around the time that you described drawing your ASP?

Correct.

Uh, you drew your ASP. You deployed it as far as extending it.

Correct.

Did you ever use it?

No.

Did you ever use your Taser?

No.

Did you ever use your pepper spray?

No.

And obviously you never used your firearm.
Correct.
And there’s no other weapons that you have other than personal weapons.

Right I have a - I also have a secondary firearm in my pouch. I didn’t use
either firearm.

Um, did you ever punch or strike him or...

No, I did not.

Tried to physically grab him.

Um, and during the time you were there, um, Deputy Wang is actually the
victim of an assault?

Correct.

Okay. Um, from listening to what you’ve said so far it seemed - well let - let
me just break it up. Um, the gentleman that we’ve been discussing who was
on the ground when you arrived and had at least one Taser prong that you saw
in him, um, you at some point during this incident spoke with him?

I - | attempted to, yes.

Yes. And you were trying to calm him, right?

Yes.

And did you hear other deputies and the sergeants speaking to him also?

Yes.

And were they also have the objective of trying to calm him and getting him
to comply?

Yes.

SUPPLEMENT 11 - Interview of Deputy John DeMartini

Investigation:
On October 3, 2018, I was assigned as the primary investigator for the San Mateo County District

Attorney’s Office investigation into an Officer Involved Critical Incident (OICI) which occurred on that
date involving deputies from the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

On October 5, 2018, I conducted an interview with Deputy John DeMartini of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office. Deputy DeMartini was one of five (5) deputies who were involved in a use of force
incident which included the deployment of both a Taser and pepper spray. The subject of the use of
force, decedent Chinedu Okobi was later pronounced deceased at Mills-Peninsula Hospital. This
incident occurred in the 1400 block of El Camino Real in the City of Millbrae. The interview with
Deputy DeMartini was conducted at the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office and was
documented through both audio and video recording. Also present during the interview was Attorney
Gregory Thoming of Mastagni Holstedt, APC. During the interview, I confirmed with Deputy DeMartini
he was providing a voluntary statement to the District Attorney’s Office and he had not been ordered to
provide a statement by any members of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

Prior to the beginning of the interview, Senior Inspector Massey met with Gregory Thoming who
advised us Deputy DeMartini was requesting he be allowed to review his Mobile Audio Video (MAV)
footage and any civilian video footage prior to providing a voluntary statement in this matter (see Senior
Inspector Massey’s supplemental report for further details). Thoming reviewed all the available MAV
footage and civilian video footage at the District Attorney’s Office prior to meeting with Deputy
DeMartini. Thoming then reviewed Deputy DeMartini’s MAV footage and the available civilian video
footage at the District Attorney’s Office with Deputy DeMartini prior to the interview. During the
Interview, I confirmed with Deputy DeMartini he had only viewed the two (2) videos prior to our
interview.

Interview with Deputy John DeMartini (paraphrased and not verbatim):
Deputy DeMartini stated he has worked for the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office for seventeen (17)

years. Deputy DeMartini began his career with the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, where he
worked as a Deputy Sheriff for approximately four and a half (4.5) years. Deputy DeMartini said he had
no prior law enforcement background prior to being employed by the San Francisco Sheriff's
Department. Deputy DeMartini served in the United States Army for approximately four (4) years but
was never deployed to any conflicts or combat situations. As a member of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office, Deputy DeMartini stated he has been assigned to the Corrections, Transportation and
Patrol Divisions over the course of his career. Deputy DeMartini said he was additionally assigned to the
Civil Division at the San Francisco Sheriff's Department for a short period of time. Deputy DeMartini
said he is currently assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau, where he has been assigned since October of
2017. Deputy DeMartini identified his primary assigned patrol beat as being the “Eichler Highlands”
which is the area near highway 92 and highway 280 in unincorporated San Mateo County.

Deputy DeMartini and I discussed the equipment he wore on his person on October 3, 2018. Deputy

SUPPLEMENT 11 - Interview of Deputy John DeMartini

DeMartini said he was not wearing an external ballistic vest carrier and all his equipment was carried on
his duty belt. Deputy DeMartini said his departmental issued firearm was in a holster on his right hip,
and he carried spare magazines, a set of handcuffs and a key holder along the front of his belt. Deputy
DeMartini said he carried his Taser on the left hip with his ASP (collapsible baton) and police radio to
the rear of the Taser. Deputy DeMartini said he was wearing a short-sleeved standard Sheriff's Office
wool police uniform with his name tag and badge affixed to the chest and Sheriff's Office patches on
each shoulder. Deputy DeMartini said he does not carry a secondary firearm or any other equipment
other than what he described as being on his duty belt.

Deputy DeMartini told me October 3, 2018 was an overtime shift for him and he was scheduled to work
6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Deputy DeMartini said October 3, 2018 would have been his third (3*4)
consecutive day working as October 1, 2018 and October 2, 2018 had been his regularly scheduled work
days where he had worked 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM out of the Millbrae Patrol Bureau. Deputy DeMartini
described his time off after his normal shift on October 2, 2018 prior to starting his shift on October 3,
2018 as uneventful. During those hours off work, Deputy DeMartini said he did not consume any
alcohol and was not on any medications which would impair his abilities. Deputy DeMartini described
his shifts on both October 2, 2018 and October 3, 2018 as uneventful prior to the incident which was the
subject of this interview. Deputy DeMartini said he did not have any stressful calls on October 3, 2018
prior to the incident. Deputy DeMartini noted his beat in the “Eichler Highlands” is so far away from
Millbrae that it does not typically make sense for him to respond to cover Deputies on calls in the
Millbrae area. Deputy DeMartini did not recall going to any other calls for service on October 3, 2018
and noted the “Eichler Highlands” beat is typically a “very quiet beat”.

On October 3, 2018, Deputy DeMartini said he was in Sheriff's Office vehicle #16 which is a fully
marked Ford Taurus patrol vehicle. Deputy DeMartini said he sometimes drives vehicle #16 and other
times he will drive Sheriff's Office vehicle #13 when it is available, because it is a marked Ford
Explorer (SUV) which he finds easier to get in and out of. Deputy DeMartini stated vehicle #16 was
equipped with Mobile Audio Video (MAV); however, the body-worn microphone for the vehicle was
missing. Deputy DeMartini said the body-worn microphone has been missing from vehicle #16 since at
least October 2017 when he was assigned to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau. Deputy DeMartini said he has
mentioned it’s absence to supervisors in the past, but it had not been replaced. Deputy DeMartini said
his assigned supervisor for the shift on October 3, 2018 was Sergeant David Weidner and he identified
his normal assigned supervisor as Sergeant Daniel Guiney.

I asked Deputy DeMartini if he received a full night’s sleep prior to beginning his shift on October 3,
2018. Deputy DeMartini said he had received a full night’s sleep and said he typically goes to sleep at
approximately 10:30 PM and wakes up by approximately 3:30 AM on the mornings he works. Deputy
DeMartini confirmed this was his sleep cycle before starting his shift on October 3, 2018. Deputy
DeMartini said he reports directly to the Millbrae Patrol Bureau for each shift and typically arrives at the
substation by 5:00 AM to prepare for his shift. Deputy DeMartini noted he has to come in early for his

shift to avoid traffic during his commute. Deputy DeMartini said he was assigned as a solo Deputy for
his shift as is typical of a patrol assignment at the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

I asked Deputy DeMartini to walk me through the incident which occurred in the 1400 block of El
Camino Real on October 3, 2018. I asked Deputy DeMartini to start with the point he first became aware
of the radio traffic up to the point he was relieved at the scene. Deputy DeMartini said he got to the
Millbrae Police substation at approximately noon to eat his lunch. After finishing his lunch, Deputy
DeMartini said he was checking Emails on a computer in the report writing room. Deputy DeMartini
explained that due to the placement of his radio, the volume knob will sometimes get inadvertently
turned down when he sits in arm chairs. Deputy DeMartini said he heard something being broadcast
over the air but heard it from Deputy Bryan Watt’s radio since his was tumed down and Deputy Watt
was nearby him. Deputy DeMartini asked Deputy Watt what the radio traffic was about, and Deputy
Watt told him Deputy Joshua Wang was asking for an additional unit. Deputy DeMartini said he turned
his radio back up, but did not respond right away because Deputy Wang’s beat partner, Deputy Alyssa
Lorenzatti got up and left the room to go cover Deputy Wang. Deputy DeMartini said he and Deputy
Watt started to walk out to their patrol vehicles when they heard Deputy Wang then ask for “code 3
cover”. Deputy DeMartini said Sergeant Weidner came out to his vehicle at this point and all three of
them began to respond, “code 3” to Deputy Wang’s location from the Millbrae Substation.

Deputy DeMartini said Deputy Wang put out a description of the subject which Deputy DeMartini
recalled as being “a black male with bags”. Deputy DeMartini said when he arrived in the area, he
observed a subject walking southbound on El Camino Real and said he and Deputy Lorenzatti both
exited their vehicles to attempt to contact the subject. Deputy DeMartini said they tried to talk with the
subject, though he could not recall exactly what he and Deputy Lorenzatti were saying other than
something similar to “can we talk to you” and “let me see your hands”. Deputy DeMartini said at one
point he tried to grab the subject by a wrist to try and place him in a control hold, but the subject pulled
away leaving Deputy DeMartini with a “handful of his sweater”. Deputy DeMartini said he was holding
on to the sweater sleeve and the subject was able to pull completely out of the sweater and began to walk
out into El] Camino Real. Deputy DeMartini also recalled the subject had set his bags down at some
point prior to going into the roadway. Deputy DeMartini said he tried again to grab the subject, but the
subject pulled away from him again and then Deputy Wang deployed his Taser. Deputy DeMartini said
the Taser deployment by Deputy Wang caused the subject to go to the ground, where Deputy DeMartini
and the other deputies on scene began giving the subject commands to turn over on his stomach so they
could handcuff him. Deputy DeMartini said the subject was not paying attention, was attempting to pull
the Taser “leads” out of his body and was kicking out his legs at Deputy DeMartini and the other
deputies. Deputy DeMartini recalled attempting to grasp the subject’s ankles, to try and prevent the
subject from kicking, but he was unable to hold on to the subject.

Deputy DeMartini said the subject was able to get back up on his feet and began to run eastbound across
El Camino Real into traffic. Deputy DeMartini recalled a second Taser deployment causing the subject

to fall to the ground a second time. Deputy DeMartini said the subject was somehow able to get back up
on his feet again. After the subject got to his feet, Deputy DeMartini recalled seeing Deputy Watt had
brought his ASP out. He did not believe Deputy Watt ever struck the subject with the ASP. Deputy
DeMartini said the subject then began to run eastbound across El Camino Real again and recalled the
subject being between he and Deputy Wang. Deputy DeMartini said he saw Deputy Wang now had his
ASP out as well, but because the subject was in between he and Deputy Wang, he did not see if Deputy
Wang struck the subject with the ASP or not. Deputy DeMartini said he recalled thinking in his mind
that if the subject were to grab the ASP from Deputy Wang, he was going to be able to get it away from
Deputy Wang “because of the sheer size of the guy”. Deputy DeMartini felt he needed to try and see if
he could knock the subject to the ground to prevent him from trying to grab Deputy Wang’s ASP.
Deputy DeMartini did what he described as a “shoulder check” (tackle) which caused the subject to
either trip or fall. Deputy DeMartini said this may have caused the subject to also run into Deputy Wang
because Deputy DeMartini said he, the subject and Deputy Wang all fell to the ground together. Deputy
DeMartini described them as being “behind the truck” on El Camino Real trying to gain control of the
subject. Deputy DeMartini said he was trying to grab the subject’s legs and control them, but the subject
kept kicking and the other deputies were trying to get the subject’s arms behind his back to place him in
handcuffs. Deputy DeMartini said the subject was still fighting with them and someone (unknown to
him who) deployed some pepper spray which affected some of the other deputies. Deputy DeMartini
noted they now had “blind deputies trying to control the guy”.

Deputy DeMartini said while he was attempting to control the subject’s legs, he recalled seeing
Community Service Officer (CSO) Joey Gonzales and yelling out for CSO Gonzales to go get water for
the affected deputies so they could flush their eyes and “maybe be able to see at least”. Deputy
DeMartini said that while CSO Gonzales was retrieving the water, they were able to finally get one arm
behind the subject and Deputy DeMartini was able to place one handcuff on him. They then linked a
second set of handcuffs together, due to the size of the subject’s shoulders, and Deputy DeMartini was
able to get the second handcuff on the subject’s other arm. Deputy DeMartini said once the subject was
handcuffed, he and the other deputies turned the subject up onto his side, so he was facing southbound
on El Camino Real and then ultimately moved him up in to a sitting position on the ground. Deputy
DeMartini said Deputy Bryan Watt was standing behind the subject using his legs as a backrest to
support the subject upright. Deputy DeMartini noted that Deputy Watt had been blinded by pepper spray
so he relieved him and continued to support the subject upright while Deputy Watt flushed his eyes out
with water. Deputy DeMartini said he continued to support the subject in an upright seated position
while waiting for the arrival of paramedics, whom Deputy DeMartini said had already been summoned
to the scene. Ultimately, Deputy DeMartini said he was relieved by another deputy (he was unsure which
one) and was asked by Sergeant Weidner to go take photographs of the scene and get statements from
possible witnesses. Deputy DeMartini said he was away from the area of the location where the subject
was detained for quite a while and when he returned, medics had placed the subject on a gurney and
were loading him into an ambulance.

SUPPLEMENT 11 - Interview of Deputy John DeMartini

Lasked Deputy DeMartini how the subject was acting once he was being propped up in a seated position.
Deputy DeMartini said the subject was not alert, but he could hear him breathing. Deputy DeMartini
said the subject had his head facing downward so he lifted the subject’s head back to assist the subject in
breathing better and recalled checking the subject for a pulse. Deputy DeMartini said he felt a pulse but
could not be completely certain now that what he was feeling was the subject’s pulse or his own since he
had “just been wrestling around with the guy”.

Deputy DeMartini said when he first arrived on the scene and first saw the subject, the subject was
walking on the sidewalk. Deputy DeMartini did not recall ever hearing Deputy Wang broadcast a
clothing description and believed only a physical description had been provided. I asked Deputy
DeMartini what indicated to him the subject he observed was the same subject Deputy Wang was
attempting to contact. Deputy DeMartini explained he could see Deputy Wang further north on the same
side of El Camino Real and Deputy Wang had broadcast the subject was walking southbound away from
him and toward the incoming units. Deputy DeMartini added his belief the subject was the only other
person in the area as well. Deputy DeMartini said Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti was the first deputy he saw
attempt to contact the subject, but said he was not able to see exactly what attempt Deputy Lorenzatti
made to detain the subject due to the fact the subject was between him and Deputy Lorenzatti at the
time. Deputy DeMartini said he saw her attempt to grab the subject, but he could not see where on the
subject she tried to grab. I asked Deputy DeMartini what the subject did in response to Deputy
Lorenzatti’s attempt to grab him and Deputy DeMartini said “he was pulling away from everybody”.
Deputy DeMartini went on to say the subject had already “thrown his bags” to the ground before they
had got to him which told him, based on his own experience “somebody is getting ready to use their
hands. They don’t want to be incumbered” and had in his mind that the subject was possibly getting
prepared to fight.

I asked Deputy DeMartini if he heard the subject say anything as they attempted to contact him. Deputy
DeMartini said the subject was saying something, but he could not remember what was being said. I
asked Deputy DeMartini if the subject was down on the ground face down or face up after the first Taser
deployment took him to the ground. Deputy DeMartini said, “He was supine. He was face up”. Deputy
DeMartini recalled seeing one Taser probe in the subject’s torso and one in the back of the subject’s
hand. Deputy DeMartini pointed to the right side of his own chest and the back of his left hand as he
described the locations to me. Deputy DeMartini reiterated his belief the Taser was deployed a total of
two (2) times and the second deployment was a reactivation of the Taser with the probes still attached
from the first deployment. Deputy DeMartini described these two (2) activations as the two (2) times the
subject fell to the ground, but added he was making an assumption the Taser was activated the second
time by the reaction of the subject and him falling to the ground as he did not recall hearing the
“clacking” sound of the Taser during the second perceived deployment.

I asked Deputy DeMartini to describe the physical appearance of the subject to me. Deputy DeMartini
described the subject as a black male who was approximately 6’3” to 6’4” in height and weighed “in the

threes”, referring to the subject as having been over three hundred (300) pounds. Deputy DeMartini
further described the subject as “a large guy”. Deputy DeMartini said when he first got up to the subject,
the subject’s eyes were “wide open” and “his pupils were pretty pinned out”. I asked Deputy DeMartini
if he felt the subject was possibly suffering from some sort of mental illness or if he was possibly under
the influence. Deputy DeMartini stated to me “one or the other or both. I would say”. I asked Deputy
DeMartini how the subject was reacting during the Taser deployment. Deputy DeMartini said the subject
at first was reacting as if the Taser was effective, but when he was on the ground the subject made
attempts to “pull the probes out”. Deputy DeMartini said the Taser deployment “was effective in that
he...he went down, but it wasn’t effective in that, like you know ‘I didn’t like the way that felt so ’m
gonna comply’ type thing” and added “he just kinda shrugged it off’. I asked Deputy DeMartini if this
was consistent behavior from other Taser deployments he had seen and Deputy DeMartini said, “In the
few tasings I’ve seen, no”. Deputy DeMartini went on to state normal persons, not under the influence or
having mental health issues, generally will comply after having a Taser utilized on them. I asked Deputy
DeMartini if he ever deployed any of his own less-lethal options during the incident and he told me he
did have his Taser out at one point in time after he had taken the subject to the ground and they were
trying to get him in handcuffs. Deputy DeMartini said he did not think he ever turned the Taser on and
he returned it to his holster because they had the subject contained on the ground. Deputy DeMartini
described the time period where he returned the Taser to the holster as being after “everyone had been
pepper sprayed”. I asked Deputy DeMartini if he was affected by the pepper spray. Deputy DeMartini
said Deputy Lorenzatti was in front of him and “took the brunt of it” but did describe feeling some
effects of it near his left eye but said he could still see.

Deputy DeMartini said he did not believe he had ever had any contact with the subject before and did
not recall ever seeing him on the streets or when he worked inside the jail, nor did he recognize him as
anyone he had ever seen walking around “Millbrae proper”. I asked Deputy DeMartini if he ever saw the
subject “strike” or “physically assault” any of the other involved deputies. Deputy DeMartini said “I
didn’t see that. No”. Deputy DeMartini said he did observe physical injuries on Deputy Wang’s face, but
said the subject was between he and Deputy Wang just before Deputy DeMartini took the subject to the
ground. Deputy DeMartini said he could see the subject advancing toward Deputy Wang and
demonstrated to me the subject was flailing his hands toward Deputy Wang, but he could not see past
the subject to see what exactly had occurred. I asked Deputy DeMartini about any injuries he sustained,
and he described abrasions on both hands, his right elbow and both knees and said he knew he sustained
the injuries because of going to the ground with the subject.

Ihad Deputy DeMartini describe the actions of the other involved deputies once they were on the ground
during the final struggle with the subject. Deputy DeMartini described the other deputies as all
attempting to gain control of the subject, primarily the subject’s arms so they could place him in
handcuffs. Deputy DeMartini said he did not believe the subject’s arms were underneath him on the
ground but were not behind his back either. Deputy DeMartini described the subject as a “very strong
guy”. Deputy DeMartini confirmed he was the one who placed the handcuffs on the subject because

SUPPLEMENT 11 - Interview of Deputy John DeMartini

everyone else had just been pepper sprayed and he was the only one who could see. Deputy DeMartini
said he did not notice if any of the taser probes were still in the subject when he placed him in handcuffs.
I asked Deputy DeMartini if there was any use of other less-lethal options other than the single pepper
spray deployment during the final struggle to get the subject handcuffed. Deputy DeMartini said he did
not believe anything other than physical attempts to control the subject were used and said he never
observed the carotid or vascular neck restraint being utilized on the subject at anytime. I asked Deputy
DeMartini if the subject was yelling while they were struggling on the ground. Deputy DeMartini said
the subject was still “being vocal” but he could not remember what the subject was saying.

I spoke with Deputy DeMartini regarding his traming. Deputy DeMartini said he had not ever attended a
course designed to aid in the recognition of subjects who are under the influence of a controlled
substance but does have experience in dealing with persons who are under the influence during his
career and is generally aware of the signs and symptoms of persons who are under the influence. Deputy
DeMartini said he has attended Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and said he went through the course
approximately four (4) or five (5) months prior to this incident. Deputy DeMartini said he has used some
of the techniques he learned in CIT effectively since attending the course. Deputy DeMartini did not
believe the techniques would have been effective in this incident as the subject was so “agitated to the
point where it wouldn’t have sunk in. I don’t think he would have listened”. Deputy DeMartini said he
has maintained his POST mandated perishable skills such as defensive tactics and attends update

training as assigned to do so by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.

I asked Deputy DeMartini if he believed this was a situation where he and the other involved deputies
could have “walked away” rather than attempt to detain the subject. Deputy DeMartini said he did not
believe so and went on to cite the subject’s demeanor, the fact the subject was an on-going danger to
himself and possibly a danger to the general public given the fact the subject was walking in and out of a
very high traffic area of El Camino Real at a busy time of the day. Deputy DeMartini said he was not
certain as to what exactly had transpired between the subject and Deputy Wang prior to his arrival, but
based upon his own observations of the subject, he felt the subject was likely a danger to himself and
needed to be evaluated for a mental health or a “5150” hold. Deputy DeMartini said the subject’s large
size, the fact he was “very” strong and they had great difficulty in attempting to control the subject were
also a concern to him as he felt that if the subject were able to get away from them, he could possibly
cause injuries to the involved deputies, to himself and to members of the public.

After a short break, I spoke with Deputy DeMartini regarding his vision. Deputy DeMartini told me he
wears glasses for reading only and had them on the top of his head during the incident until they were
knocked off during one point in the altercation. Deputy DeMartini described the scene as well-lit due to
it being mid-day and said his vision was not impaired by the effects of the pepper spray during the final
portion of the struggle to get the subject handcuffed. Deputy DeMartini described the only point where
his ability to view what was occurring was obscured as being when they were all upright and the subject
was between he and Deputy Wang.

SUPPLEMENT 11 - Interview of Deputy John DeMartini

At the culmination of my interview, I allowed Gregory Thoming to ask any questions he might have for
Deputy DeMartini. Thoming asked Deputy DeMartini if, based upon his twenty-three (23) years in law
enforcement, if Deputy DeMartini felt his actions, the actions of his fellow deputies, and the actions of
his sergeant in this incident were appropriate. Deputy DeMartini stated his belief they were.

not be making eye contact and looking down and I don’t wanna seem like I -
rude - I’m just making sure that we check everything off and, you know, that
even if I’m assuming eye contact - I’m not saying stop talking.

Yeah, mm-hm.

And you can still continue to finish your thoughts and things like that. So, just

. your normal regular shift, um, uneventful? Or was there anything interesting
going on outside of work?

The shift or when I got off?

When you got off?

No - went home.

Okay. Um, did you have anything to drink - alcohol - when you were home?
No, you didn’t? Um, do you take any medications or anything that would have
impaired your abilities?

Nope. Nothing...

You’re not prescribed any medications? Okay. Um, the previous shift - the
Tuesday shift - was that a regular shift? Was anything stressful about it? Was
it just a routine shift?

Regular shift, yeah.

Mm-kay. Now the shift of Wednesday which you started at 6:00 am?
Correct.

Up till about 1:00 when this incident occurred - how was that shift?

Um, for me it was uneventful. I spent most of it on the 40 Beat. Some of it in
the office doing some last minute report stuff.

Any stressful calls at all?

Nope.

Any r- responding for code three cover or anything like that?
Not prior to this one.

There was a call but I was so - I was so far up on the 40 Beat it wouldn’t have

We talked a little bit - I mean we went over most of your equipment on your

You said there were no eventful calls during the Wednesday shift. Um, what
type of calls did you handle at that point?

Oh my God. Like, oh, I can’t think of any on Wednesday prior to this.

The Eichler Highlands Beat is a fairly...

It’s very quiet.

Very quiet beat, yes.

Yeah.

Okay. Especially on day shift I would assume?

Yes. I mean I might of ha- I can’t remem- it was uneventful. So...

Okay. So, nothing that would stick out in your mind?

No.

Then - what I’m gonna do now is kind of focus on the actual incident.

Okay.

Um, so starting at about 1:00 when this is dispatched. What I would like you
to talk to me about is when you first became aware of it, what you first heard
on the radio...

Okay.

..and walk me through the entire incident up to the point where you’re kind of
relieved and pulled out of it.

Okay.

Um, and then we’ ll - I might interrupt you periodically to ask some questions
but for the most part I’m gonna let you tell your story and I’ll try to ask the
questions...

Mm-hm.

..afterwards. But before we get into that I wanna talk about the fact that prior
to coming in here you did have a chance to look at some video?

Yes.
And what videos did you watch?

I watched, uh, the video from my MAV video and I guess one of the citizen’s
videos.

The cell phone video?
Right.

Okay. Um, as we’re going through the story, uh, there’s gonna be some things
that you remember distinctly as happening.

Mm-hm.

And there’s gonna be some things that may have been - that you didn’t
remember or that you just kinda saw for the first time on the video. If it’s
something that going from your memory - that’s great. If it’s something that
you remember now because of the video I would like you to tell me...

Mm-hm.

...that’s it from the video, um, as we go forward. And - and that’s my only
kind of question with that. So, if you can go ahead and tell me.

Yeah, I got to the Millbrae substation, oh, noonish to eat my lunch. So I sat in
there and did my lunch. Um, got up, went to the report writing room, sat down
at a computer - I think I was looking at emails, something innocuous, um, for
a bit. Um, I mighta been looking at the TRAK fliers... s- something.

Right.

Um, m- sometimes when I sit down in chairs my radio knob hits the armchair
and gets turned down. So I heard something - not mine, ‘cause it was turned
down from, uh, Bryan Watt’s. So I asked him, “Hey, wa- what did he just
say?” It was - I guess Wang. He said, “Oh, he’s asking for additional - an
additional unit.” So I said, okay, so, I turn my radio back up and his partner -
Lorenzatti I think had already left after hearing it. And Bryan and got and we
were leaving. And as were walking out we heard it upgraded to code three
cover. So, we go to our cars, I see Sergeant Weidner leave and get in his car.
Bryan leaves - Sergeant Weidner then me. We’re code three to his location.
We get to the location, um, he’s putting out the description of the individual -
a black male with bags. Um, get there and I see the individual walking down

southbound ECR. Uh, I get out - Lorenzatti gets out and go and contact him. I
think we’re talking, hey, s- you know, doing (unintelligible), you know, let me
talk to you, what’s going on. And then let me see your hands, I think was said
- I can’t remember. Um, at one point - I think I reached to grab him by the
wrist a- and attempted to control hold - didn’t work. He pulls out and I end up
with a handful of his sweater. And so now I got his sweater sleeve and he
comes out of the sweater and starts g- walking out on ECR. So I put the
sweater down. M- he’s also throwing his bags down - his duffel bags. And,
uh, tried to gain control again. He’s just - tore away at some point. Um,
Deputy Wang deployed his Taser. The individual goes to the ground. Um,
trying to give more, i- commands to turn over so we can cuff him. He’s not
paying attention, he’s trying to pull his - the leads out, um, kicking. So at one
point I try to kinda grab his ankles to keep him from kicking everybody. But, I
wasn’t able to. He gets up again and starts running into - into where traffic
was on ECR eastbound I believe. Um, I think he gets another tase and he goes
down again. At some point he gets back up. Um, I think Bryan had his ASP
out. Um, I don’t think he s- hit him with hit. I can’t remember. He starts
running eastbound across ECR again. And from my recollection I think at that
point Wang is in - kinda in front of him. It’s the suspect and then me and
Wang had his ASP out. I didn’t see him take a swing or anything.
(Unintelligible) between - he was between me and him. And at some point, in
my mind I was thinking if this guy grabs that ASP from Wang he’s gonna get
it. You know, ‘cause the sheer size of the guy. So, I said he needs - I need to
see if I could knock him to the ground. So I did. I kinda shoulder checked him
and, uh, either he tripped or fell and I think it - I’m not sure but I think at the
same time he ran into Wang and he fell - then I fell — that’s where I got all
these...

Okay.

Um, then his - that’s - he was - moved behind the truck - middle of ECR
trying to control - I was trying to control his legs ‘cause he was still kicking.
And everyone else was trying to get his hands out from underneath him
behind his back to cuff him. He was still fighting with us. Um, at some point
someone deployed some pepper spray. I’m not sure who it was. But, other
deputies got affected. So now we have blind deputies trying to control the
guy. And, so, I was still controlling his legs and I told, um, I think it was the
SRO — Joey.

Okay.

I said, Hey, go get some water in that - there’s a restaurant, go get some
bottles of water for these guys so they can flush their eyes out so they could
maybe see at least. So, he goes off - does it. As he gone I think we finally get
one arm out free and I put one cuff on - linked it with another set of cuffs

“cause of his size and cuffed it with the other arm. He comes back with the
water. They were s- dousing their eyes. We turn him on his side. So now he’s
facing southbound...

Okay.

..With his face. And, uh, then we put him in a sitting position. Everyone was
still washing out their stuff and Bryan is blinded with the pepper spray, he has
got his - his leg behind his back to prop him as he’s sitting up.

The subject?

Correct. I, uh, at some point I went over to relieve Bryan so he could wash his
eyes out, so, I’m holding him. Um, at that point, I - I think prior to that medics
were called. They were - I heard ‘em incoming - the sirens. Um, and someone
else - I can’t remember who - took over for me and I was told to go get
statements and look for video cameras and whatnot. So I was away from that
particular scene for quite a while.

Okay.

And then by the time I came back to the scene medics where there and they’re
putting him on a gurmey, he was going.

Okay. At the point when he was, um, being propped up by you, or, well...
Mm-hm.

...first Deputy Watt...

Mm-hm.

..and then - then you - how was he acting at that point? Was he awake - was
he alert - was he...

He wasn’t alert. Um, I could hear him breathing. Um, at one point I think - so
I could help him breathe better I - I kinda raised his head up a little bit. ‘Cause
he was down this way so his chin was kinda like this. So I raised his head up
and I’m - I’m assuming he was breathing. I tried checking his carotid and I
was getting a pulse. I can’t be honest and say it was - I don’t know if it was
his I was feeling or mine - ‘cause I was just wrestling around with the guy.
But it was something going on there.

So, that’s pretty much it.

Mm-kay. When you - you talked about first kinda getting there and you saw
him walking southbound...

Correct.

..on ECR. Where was he?

Mmm.

You know, in the roadway ot...

No, he was on the sidewalk at that point, yeah.

He was on the sidewalk, okay. Um, and did you see, like, the clothing he was
wearing and everything...

Yeah.

..at that point? Uh, had you heard a clothing description from Officer Wang
when you were responding or just a physical description?

I think it was just a physical - I can’t be a - I can’t be sure though.

Mm-hm. How did you know that this was the - the person? I mean what told
you that this was the guy...

Well he was - Wang was - it was - Wang was up further north m- on Santa
Helana making a turn. He was telling us, oh, that’s - he’s walking southbound
down ECR. He was the only one...

Over his radio he was...

...1 think he was the only one there.

Over his ra- radio he was...

Correct.

...telling you this? Okay. Uh, who was the first person to try and make contact
with him when you were there? Was it - was it you - was it Lorenzatti?

I think it was Lorenzatti.

I can’t remember. He was saying something but I can’t remember what he was
saying.

Okay. Was it that you just can’t recall what he said or was it not something
that you could understand?

Ican’t recall.
Okay.
Yeah.

Um, you talked about once he’s on the ground the first time where the Taser
has been deployed and he’s...

Correct.

..down on the ground. Was he face down - face up?
Oh, he was supine, he was face up.

Okay. And that’s when you guys were trying to...

Get control...

..get a hold of him and (unintelligible).

Correct.

Could you see at that point that the probes were in him?

Yeah, I saw there was one - I (unintelligible) I’m not sure if there’s one is in
his - his torso - I’m pretty sure. I know one was in his hand.

Okay. Like the back of his hand?

“Cause I saw one in the back of his hand.

Correct. But in this time and I think he - with the probe still in he - he was
tased. He just reactivated the trigger.

And that’s when he had gotten back up?

Up originally. Started running into traffic and then went back down.
So he was up and down twice...

Right.

...at that point and then - then...

And - and - and that’s just my assumption. I don’t think I heard the clacking
of the Taser. But, I mean his legs locked up and he just went over. So...

Okay, so the way he fell...

Correct.

Okay. Um, what can you tell me about the physical description of this guy?
Oh, black male, I’m gonna say 6’3” - 6’4” ish. Um, probably in the 3s, yeah.
So - so a very big guy.

Yeah. He was a large guy. Um, when I got out of the - when I got - initially
got to him and was looking at him in the face, um, his eyes were wide open
and it looked like his pupils were pretty pinned out. So, that’s not average

looking sort of eyes.

Okay. Do you feel like he was possibly suffering some mental illness or under
the influence or...

One or the other or both. I - I would say.

Yeah. How was he reacting to the Taser deployment? Was he acting like it
was working or...

At first he did and then like I said when he was on the ground he was trying to
pull the probes out. So...

Mm-kay. And...

It was effective in that he - he went down. But, it wasn’t effective in that, you

know, I didn’t like the way that felt, so I’m gonna comply kinda thing.

Okay.

He just kinda shrugged it off.

Okay. Is that something that you are - have typically seen?

Um, in the few tasings I’ve seen - no, generally when they get tased first -
depending on what’s - the mental or, you know, anything else on board is
considered - but, just normal average people - generally they’re gonna comply

after being tased.

Mm-kay. Um, did at any point - did you ever bring out any of your other less
lethal weapons?

Yeah, when we were originally over at - at the, uh, by the truck when he
finally went down - I had my Taser out but I re- re-holstered it.

Okay. So you never deployed it...

I never - yeah deployed it. I don’t think I ever turned it on.
Okay. And why’d you put it away?

Because there - we had him under control and it was sufficient - at that point.
Yeah. Was he cuffed at that point or just you had him...

I th- not - not yet - he wasn’t cuffed yet. But...

But people were on top of him.

Right, everyone had just been pepper sprayed, so...

Okay.

Had you ever seen this guy before?
I don’t think so.

Okay.

I don’t think so.

So, no prior interactions with him?
Not with me, no.

Okay. Um, and your pre- pretty familiar with that Millbrae area and the

I had been there for a while, but it’s (unintelligible)...
Okay.

.... would imagine - I haven’t seen him in the jail and I worked the jail. I don’t
recognize him. I recognize him from Millbrae proper walking around.

Okay. And I think that - I think from what you said the only time you saw the
paramedics treating him was - as they were already...

Correct.

.. leaving with him or getting ready to leave with him.

To the best of your knowledge he was?

Yeah.

Yes.

Okay. Um, you talked about the, uh, the CSO that was there...

I don’t think so.

He was there pretty early on though - is his truck was...

or physically assault any of them?

I didn’t see that, no.
Okay.

Like I say, the only one I know that any kind of injuries was Wang. But I
(unintelligible)...

So you saw some physical injuries on him?

I know he was going after him. There was hands and things. So, which is why
I thought, God, don’t let him get this ASP out of Wang’s hands, you know.

And this is about the point that you...

Yes.

..took him to the ground?

Yes.

Okay.

At least I think it was me. I don’t know. I know I - I ran into him. But...

Okay. Was there ever an opportunity where you or any of the other officers
were able to identify yourself as police officers to him?

Verbally?
Yes.

Uh, I don’t remember. I mean ...rolled up in marked police cars in full
uniform, so...

And was the emergency equipment...

Oh, yeah.

...on on the vehicles?

Oh, yeah.

And functioning properly?

Yeah. Yeah, MAV doesn’t come on unless you hit the lights, so.

Okay. And you have some scrapes and scrapes and abrasions that you talked
to...

(Unintelligible) here, elbow and knees, Mm-hm.

And you believe those happened kinda at the end point when he went to the
ground?

Oh, I know that’s when it happened.

Okay. When you went to the ground with him?
Correct.

Or kinda during the struggle?

When I went to the ground with him.

Okay. And just so the record’s clear - when you said here are you talking
about your hand?

Uh, this one - this...

It looks like the forearm.

Yeah, and through here.

Okay.

And my knees.

Yep. Did that cause any damage to your uniform?
Yeah.

Um, what happened to your uniform then?

Uh, my knee and my right knee got a scuff. I don’t think all - went all the way
through.

Okay.

“Cause looks like it’s about ready to.

Okay.

Huh.

When he was on the ground. Once he had gone to the ground - whether you

took him to the ground or somebody else did. Um, what was everybody else
doing? You talked about holding his legs...

Yeah.

...for the most part.

Uh, I think - I think most people were just trying to hold him in place from
flaying and kicking and trying to get up again. You know, accompanied with
trying to get his arm out so we could place handcuffs on him.

So did he have his arms underneath his body or...

I can’t remember. I - I don’t - I don’t think so. I think he’s just a strong guy.
And we couldn’t...

They weren’t behind him though?
I don’t think so.

Okay. And you describe putting the handcuffs on and s- was it you that put the
handcuffs on him?

Yes, ‘cause everyone else had just been pepper sprayed.
Okay.

So I was the only one who could see.

Okay. Uh...

So they had one set on and then I got my set out and double linked it and then
someone was able to get his other arm up and I think it was only one click.

Oh...
So, not sure.

Okay. Um, were the t- were you able to see if any of the Taser prongs were
still in at that point?

I didn’t get - notice.
Okay. Like his hand one?
I didn’t notice.

there any other deployment of anything - either Taser or ASP...

I don’t think so.

...carotid restraint or anything.

I think it was just the pepper spray - there wasn’t carotid at all.

Okay. You didn’t see anybody put...

I didn’t see anything, yeah.

And certainly, you were at his legs, so...

Correct.

Okay. Was he still yelling at this point or was he kind of quiet at this point?
Can’t remember. He was being vocal but I don’t know what he was saying.
Yeah. So he was making some...

Yes.

..some sort of noises? During your career obviously had to take a lot of
training classes...

Hm.

..and things like that. So I wanna talk to a little bit about some of those ones
that you’ve taken. Have you taken any classes to recognize persons under the
influence - like a DRE class or 11550?

I haven’t taken 11-5 or DRE.

Okay. You’ve worked in a custodial setting quite a bit...

Yes.

under the influence?

Uh, gen- in general, yes.

Okay. Not to do an evaluation of them but...
Correct.

..enough to make a perception?

Correct.

Okay. Um, have you had any training in CIT?
Yes.

Okay. How long ago was that if you remember?
Oh, four or five months ago.

Oh, so very recently.

Yeah.

Okay. And is it something that you’ve been able to use so far in your daily

Some of the techniques?

um, agitated?... to the point where I don’t think he would of - it wouldn’t have

Okay. Um, you’ve had defensive tactics or...

..arrest and control technique...

Yes.

Uh, whenever the Sheriff’s Office - whenever they’re scheduled I think it’s
twice a year.

Twice a year?

Okay. Um, tactical communications or verbal judo...
Right.

I haven’t had that in quite a while, but I’ve had it.

Okay, so no special paramedic classed or tactical medical...
No.

..or anything like that. Okay. Um, to carry the Taser you have to go through
some training.

Correct.

Um, I assume you’ve been through that training. Um, did y- have you ever felt
the effects of the Taser?

No.

Okay. So you were not in one of those classes where they made you get tased?
No. They stopped that.

Yes. Unfortunately I was in one of those classes.

No.

Um, prior to law enforcement did you have any military experience or
anything?

Yes.

Yeah.

Okay. When you were first getting on scene and seeing this guy walk
southbound on El Camino, um, it sounds like you and Lorrenzatti got there
pretty close to the same time...

Mm-hm.

...from what you’re describing to me. Uh, what were you guys trying to do
with him?

Trying to...

What was your goal?
...to detain him.
Okay. And why?

Because he was the subject of, uh, Deputy Chan calling for a code three cover.
So...

Mm-kay. And you already talked a little bit about why you knew that he was
the person.

Right.

Uh, would this have been a situation you think you could of just walked
away?

I don’t think so.
And how come?

Um I think based on his demeanor at the time he would probably been an
ongoing danger to himself number | and possibly also the public at large.

Given the fact he was walking in and out of the traffic on El Camino Real at |
o’clock in the afternoon. So...

A high traffic area.

Very.

And that’s from the very first encounter - you didn’t feel...
Correct.

..It was a situation that you could back away.

Correct.

And as it progressed, um, did you still feel that - that he needed to be
detained?

Yes.

Okay. And how come?

Uh, well, my initial thought was because I felt, like I said, he was a danger to
himself - other people and probably should be evaluated for 5150. Um, I
wasn’t quite sure what happened between him and Wang earlier in the call
“cause I wasn’t there.

Right.

So, it was just pretty much that whole conglomeration of situations.

Okay. Did you have any concerns in regards to his size while you guys were
trying detain him?

Absolutely. That was one of the first things that crossed my mind when I
rolled on scene was his size.

One of the first observations you noted to...
Absolutely.
Okay. Um, in addition to the size was he also strong?

Very strong.

SAN MATEO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE } pee |
(=) 400 COUNTY CENTER, 3RD FLOOR REDWOOD CITY, CA 94063 650-363-4636
SUPPLEMENT 12 - Interview of Deputy Joshua Wang

Investigation:
On October 4", 2018, at 1:30 PM, I interviewed SMCSO Deputy Joshua Wang in the interview room of

the San Mateo County District Attorney's Office. The interview was recorded to a DVD. Present in the
room was also Deputy Wang’s legal counsel, Attorney Zeb Davis, of Mastagni Holstedt. The following
is a summary of my interview of Deputy Wang:

Wang began the interview by confirming this was a voluntary interview, of his own free will, and that he
had not been ordered to participate in the interview.

I then asked Wang some background questions and he responded in summary as follows:

Wang is a Deputy with the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office, assigned badge #1100, and has been
employed there since February of 2018, assigned solely to Patrol. Prior to that he was employed as a
peace officer by the San Francisco Police Department for a little over 4 years. His only other related law
enforcement experience prior to SFPD was as a non-sworn, police volunteer for the San Carlos Police
Department, assisting with tasks such as marking abandoned vehicles and parking enforcement.

Wang worked later in the Patrol Division for SFPD, assigned to the Specialist Team which is a unit that
responds to critical incidents in progress, assists SWAT with high risk search warrants, and as a security
detail for various gatherings and protests. He has no significant background in martial arts or combat
sports and no military experience. He is right handed, using his right hand for most tasks on a daily
basis.

I asked Wang to describe his attire on October 3, 2018, the date of the incident in question. He said he
was wearing a long-sleeve, wool uniform shirt, with SMCSO patches on both shoulders, metal badge,
metal nametag, leather “duty belt”, long wool uniform pants and black “Danner” boots. His radio
microphone was clipped to the front of his shirt and he had the audio microphone for his vehicle MAV
(Mobile Audio Video) clipped to his right shoulder. He was wearing his firearm and holster on the right

handcuffs, his patrol radio, a collapsible baton, 2 additional firearm magazines, and his Taser X26,
which was holstered to his left hip for a “non-dominant hand draw”.

Wang explained that he was on-duty on October 3, 2018, working from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, which is
his normal shift. He worked an overtime shift on October 2, 2018, at the Millbrae sub-station, working
the same shift hours, which he identified as “Team 2”. He told me nothing “high stress” or out of the
ordinary occurred during the overtime shift. He said he slept about 6 hours the night prior to the
incident in question. He did not consume any alcohol on October 3, 2018, prior to his shift. He does not
currently take any prescription medication.

On October 3, 2018, Wang got dressed in his uniform at about 5:30 AM and attended morming briefing
where they discussed patrol issues within the City of Millbrae. He said he felt “fine” at the start of the

shift and was looking forward to vacationing with his wife in the near future.

I then asked Deputy Wang to provide me a complete, uninterrupted account of the incident itself,
inviting him to speak at his own pace, with the intention of describing the events as they transpired in
chronological order. I also invited his counsel to interrupt at any time if need be as he explained what
occurred from beginning to end. The following is a summary of that account:

Wang was driving SMCSO marked patrol vehicle #10, which is a Ford, Explorer, traveling southbound
on El Camino Real in Millbrae, approaching the intersection with Millwood Drive. He observed a male
walking eastbound on Millwood, across El Camino Real, crossing 3 lanes of traffic “walking in the
intersection when he was not permitted to do so.” Wang explained he knew this because he could see
that the northbound facing traffic signal for southbound traffic was green. The male then stepped up
onto the center median of the roadway. Wang said he decided to make a “traffic enforcement stop and
contact him.”

Wang activated his emergency overhead lights and made a U-Turn, pulling alongside the male who was
now walking northbound. He described the male as an “African American male, large in stature,
carrying numerous bags.” Wang rolled his driver’s side window down and told the male, “Something
along the lines of, ‘Hey I need to talk to you’ or ‘Hey, stop, hold on.” The male ignored Wang and
continued to walk northbound along El Camino Real. Wang then accelerated past the male, stopped and
tried to exit his vehicle to contact the male on foot. He said the male was now walking within the actual
roadway, creating a hazard for oncoming traffic. He told me, “I was bound to this subject now...he’s
walking in traffic. He may get struck by a vehicle or cause an accident.”

Wang then notified SMCSO Communications that he was trying to stop a pedestrian within the roadway
and needed assistance, believing he would need additional assistance to safely contact the male in the
busy roadway, given the high volume of traffic at that time. He said the male continued northbound on
El Camino Real, sometimes walking within the northbound lanes, then sometimes on the median, and
occasionally veering into the southbound lanes as well. Wang said traffic was starting to back up
because of the hazard. He added, “Cars were maneuvering to avoid hitting him and he just continued to
walk in traffic”, and, “It seemed like he had no regard for his own safety or the safety of the people that
were (driving) in the roadway.

Wang continued by saying the male walked within the roadway for an “extended period of time,”
creating a more “exigent public safety matter,” and continued to ignore Wang who kept his overhead
emergency vehicle lights activated the entire time. Wang called for more assistance, recalling that he
clarified with the communications dispatcher at the time that he was not “in pursuit” of the subject, but
was instead forced to complete several U-turns to maintain a visual observation of the male.

At one point Wang accelerated away from the male, anticipating that he needed to make another U-turn

to re-approach the male again by traveling southbound on El Camino Real. He proceeded southbound on
El Camino Real and noticed multiple SMCSO vehicles approaching “Code 3” from the opposite
direction, seemingly responding to his call for assistance. The male started walking southbound on El
Camino Real towards the vehicle for Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti. Wang watched as Lorenzatti exited her
vehicle and made a “forceful” hand motion towards the subject that to Wang indicated she was either
ordering the male to the ground or ordering him to drop the bags in his hands. Lorenzatti was
accompanied by Deputy John DeMartini. Wang indicated that he became “even more worried” because
the subject was clearly larger in size and stature than both deputies and he “may be able to overpower”
both of them, “if the altercation became physical.”

Wang accelerated his vehicle to close ground and assist with contacting and possibly detaining the
subject. As he approached he saw both deputies grab for the subject’s arms and he responded by pulling
away from their grasp, “flinging his hands in the air.” Wang then exited his car and ran towards them.
He grabbed the male’s right hand and tried to secure it to the small of the subject’s back in a “control
hold”, expecting to handcuff the male. However, he stated, “I wasn’t physically able to place his right
hand behind his back because his level of resistance was much stronger than my level of force and I
could tell quickly I wasn’t going to be able to control him myself.”

Wang backed away from the subject to create distance between them, “because I wasn’t physically able
to control him.” Wang admitted he was “getting a little scared...I’m not a big guy, ’m not a really
strong guy but in most of my prior law enforcement encounters when I’ve had to physically restrain
someone I’m usually able to gain control of one of their arms using both of my arms.”

Wang stepped back while the male was still standing in the roadway and un-holstered his Taser,
believing he would need to “try another force option beyond physical control.” He released the thumb
safety for the device and aimed it at the male’s chest. He then warmed the male, “If you don’t comply
(or) get on the ground you are going to get Tased.” The male ignored the command and Wang deployed
his Taser. He said, “I remember hearing the pop and...I hoped it would be enough to gain compliance
from him.” He added, “It seemed like it had an effect on him...I think he fell to the ground and I notified
dispatch we had deployed a Taser.” He then requested that a paramedic unit “stage” because of the
Taser deployment, per SMCSO policy.

Wang said that the other deputies on the scene moved in and tried unsuccessfully to physically detain
and/or handcuff the male while he was on the ground. The male continued to resist and Wang gave a
second order for the male to “get on the ground and get on his stomach.” He added, “He refused to
comply and I activated my Taser for a second time.” (The X26 Taser is only loaded with one probe
cartridge at a time so Wang is referring to activating the already deployed probes a second time,
believing they were still in contact with the male.) Wang said the male was “still very much agitated,
speaking incoherently, excited,” and still ignoring orders to roll over and lay on his stomach to be
handcuffed. Wang deployed his Taser a third time. He said, “I remember thinking ‘I hope this it...I

hope he realizes we can’t just walk away’ ...I hoped he would just give up and surrender.”

Wang watched as Deputy Bryan Watt now moved in and tried again to place the male in a control hold
to be handcuffed but, “he was trying to pull away from Deputy Watt. I could tell he was still resisting at
this point and so I believe I deployed my Taser a fourth time.” The male continued to ignore orders
from multiple officers and, “Was eventually able to get to himself to his feet on his own. He stood up
and began to run eastbound (into) the northbound lanes of traffic.”

Wang said, “At that point, I realize the Taser has been totally ineffective and...I’m going to have to
resort to another means of force to detain him.”

Wang said he dropped his Taser as the male ran within the traffic lanes. He removed his expandable
baton and repeated the same orders to the male. He said, “Again, he made no physical or verbal
indicators that he would comply.” Wang said, “At this point ’'m thinking, ‘How are we going to be able
to detain this guy? I’ve seen firsthand how strong he is...He never gave a window of opportunity for CIT
training or dialogue...never acknowledged who we were or that he was open to trying to work this out
verbally. ”

Wang expanded his baton with his right hand and told the male, “Get on the ground.” The male ignored
the order and Wang swung his baton towards the male’s lower leg, but missed. He said, “At that point I
felt him tackle me...He grabbed on to me and pulled me to the ground...I saw something out of the
corner of my eye and felt a hot stinging pain on the left side of my face. I didn’t black out but knew
something had hit me on the face.” Jn the various available videos of the event it appears at this point in
the altercation that the male struck Wang in the face once if not multiple times.

Wang then described how he was now on the ground and he could feel the male pulling on his duty belt,
recalling the sensation that the male was pulling him “in one direction” by his duty belt. Wang thought,
“Tf he reaches for my gun, I might be in a very bad situation. I felt scared that I couldn’t stop (him)
.. nothing I had done so far leading up to this had made him change his behavior or acknowledge my
presence.”

Wang said he recalled trying to stand up and trying to punch the male in self-defense, but, “I recall the
motion of swinging my fist but don’t remember ever feeling anything come into contact with my fist.”
Wang was not sure if his punch connected or if he missed. Wang remembered he then took out his OC
spray and deployed it once he obtained “a clear view” of the male’s face. He said, “Immediately upon
deploying the OC I heard other deputies scream in pain,” realizing he had missed the male with the OC.
He then placed the container back in its holster.

Wang said, “At some point I remember looking or standing up and seeing he was handcuffed.” Wang
said the male was still thrashing about and that the deputies were still trying to prevent him from getting

up. He remembered hearing the male “making noises” as one of the deputies confirmed that he was still
breathing. Wang again called for paramedics and recalled getting “So frustrated” because it seemed to
take them a long time to arrive.

The deputies then sat the male up and Wang used his knees to hold the male in a seated position. He
watched as several other deputies seem to be washing OC spray out their eyes. He said, “Then someone
told me, ‘Hey Josh, go sit down.’” Wang was relieved of his duties and sat down on the tailgate of a
nearby truck. He felt exhausted and was only able to speak in a low volume. He said, “I felt a wave of
emotions and tried to process everything that had just happened.”

Wang added that he eventually noticed CPR was being done on the subject and then Wang himself was
escorted to an ambulance after realizing he was bleeding. He later learned that the subject had died and
then it “really set in.” Jt should be noted that during his interview the cadence and level of detail
regarding Wang’s recollection of what occurred seemed to be sporadic after the point in the altercation
when he was struck in the head.

Once Wang completed his uninterrupted account of the incident, I asked some specific clarifying
questions regarding the account he had just provided. Wang’s responses are summarized here:

Wang confirmed for me that his patrol vehicle was clearly marked with SMCSO insignias on both doors,
as well as overhead lights and the words “Sheriff” on both doors.

lasked Wang if he recognized the male from any prior contacts, crime alerts, or related law enforcement
information and he replied, “No.” At the time of this interview. Wang still did not know the decedent’s
name, now identified as Chinedu Valentine Okobi.

Wang said that after he made his first U-turn to contact Okobi, Okobi was no longer in the roadway and
was instead on the sidewalk. He said that when he tried to get Okobi to stop by yelling, “Hey I need to
talk to you,” Okobi did not reply or even look at him. I asked him if he felt he gave Okobi a lawful
order. He paused and then replied, “I think I said, ‘Stop. I got to talk to you,’” while he had his overhead
lights activated. 4 review of the MAV footage from Wang’s vehicle indicates that Okobi responded with,
“What do you want?” (See supplemental prepared by Inspector Raffaelli.)

I recalled for Wang an earlier statement when he felt “this was something more,” after Okobi first
ignored his order to stop. Wang said it was based on prior experiences when “people don’t stop right
away,” when he pulls alongside them, which is why he deliberately accelerated past Okobi, into his line
of sight, and stopped his car. He said that was when Okobi averted contact with him by walking back
into traffic and on to the center median. Wang added, “At this point he had (indicated) that he was
going to try to evade me,” and that’s why he called for more assistance.

SUPPLEMENT 12 - Interview of Deputy Joshua Wang

Wang estimated he made “numerous U-turns” trying to contact Okobi until additional officers arrived on
scene to assist him.

Wang said that when he first tried to physically detain Okobi, he grabbed his right wrist, intending to
place his arm behind his back. He elaborated, “When I say that, he (Okobi) easily overcame that, I mean
he pulled his arm away from my grasp.” He did not recall if Okobi said anything when he resisted.

I asked Wang to elaborate on the initial efforts to restrain Okobi. He described how Deputies Lorenzati
and DeMartini had tried to control Okobi’s arms first, but he pulled away from them. It was after that
when Wang himself first tried to control Okobi’s right arm, but Okobi pulled away from Wang as well. I
asked Wang why he wanted to handcuff Okobi and he replied, “His behavior was unpredictable. He
would not acknowledge any of my commands. He had already displayed indications that he was trying to
evade by creating distance between myself and him and based on his physical stature, in order to prevent
him from escaping...or attacking us I felt safer having him in handcuffs before we try to engage in some
kind of meaningful dialogue.”

I asked Wang how he ascertained that he could not physically control Okobi and he replied, “Based on
the ease of which he was able to pull away from my grasp.” Wang also remarked how apparent it was to
him that Okobi was a large man, about 6’00 tall, about 250 lbs. Jt should be noted that Okobi’s stature
at the time of death was approximately 6’3”, 337 Ibs.

Wang was unsure if Okobi was looking at him when he first wamed him that he was going to Tase him,
but he was certain Okobi was facing him and only about 8 feet away, and still walking southbound on El
Camino Real within the lanes of traffic, when he deployed the Taser.

I asked Wang if Okobi had a physical reaction to being Tased the first time and he replied, “I saw his
body tense up and I think he fell to the ground.” Wang and the other deputies continued giving Okobi
orders as he was still on the ground and after the first Taser activation had ended. Okobi continued to
resist as the two deputies tried again to handcuff him. Wang gave Okobi orders, yelling, “Get on your
stomach now,” and wamed him he would be Tased again if he did not comply.

I asked Wang about the second use of the Taser, which he clarified was the re-activation of the
previously deployed probes, by pulling and releasing the trigger. I asked what physical reaction Okobi
had to the second Taser deployment and he replied, “Nothing.” Wang said he had no idea if the probes
were still in contact with Okobi, or in any position to be effective, but he recalled that Okobi had no
physical reaction to this second deployment. He said Okobi continued to physically resist the deputies,
recalling that Deputy Watt tried again to physically detain Okobi, but was unsuccessful.

I asked Wang then if he had any idea if the probes were still in contact with Okobi, or in any position to
be effective, prior to the 3'4 deployment, which was a re-activation of the same probes and he replied, “I

don’t.” He did not recall seeing the Taser wires at all.

I asked Wang how far Okobi was from him prior to the 3"? Taser activation. Wang said he was “about 6
to 8 feet” away and still on the ground, lying on his back, “moving...it wasn’t a motion like he was
trying to comply with my order to roll over on his stomach...he was flailing.” He continued to order
Okobi to “get on his stomach” just before activating his Taser a 3"! time. He pulled and released the
trigger of the Taser (allowing for a 5 second pulse) and he saw that Okobi started to get up off the
ground. He could not remember if Okobi showed any symptoms of being Tased during this third
activation and was unsure if Okobi got off the ground during or just after the 5 second pulse from this
third activation.

Wang said that once Okobi got up he still had no idea if the probes of the Taser were engaged or if they
were in contact with Okobi. He recalled seeing a “clump” of copper wires, but did not know if the
probes were attached once Okobi successfully stood up. He said Okobi, “was still uncompliant (once he
got up)...his body language never indicated he was surrendering or giving up.” Wang said Okobi was
again resisting efforts to be physically restrained, pulling away from Sergeant Weidner and Deputy Watt.

I asked Wang about his position in relationship to Okobi’s position just prior to his fourth Taser
activation. He said Okobi was “gaining distance between us, starting to run eastbound (within the lanes
of) El Camino.” Wang recalled the deputies following and “yelling” at Okobi but he could not recall
specifically what orders they were giving Okobi. Wang remained uncertain during the interview if he
actually activated the Taser a fourth time, but at this moment when he believed he may have, he had NO
recollection of Okobi reacting to being affected by the Taser in any way. He added that after reviewing
his MAV video prior to the interview, he recalled hearing the “clicking” of his Taser during this moment
as Okobi walked away from him and an unknown person told Wang to “turn it off.”

Wang confirmed that he completed his certified, 40 hour training in Crisis Intervention while he was a
member of the San Francisco Police Department, but added that he “never had a chance” to use the
training in this situation.

Lasked Wang to elaborate on his unsuccessful attempt to strike Okobi in the legs with his baton. I asked
him his justification for the attempt and he replied, “My justification was prior use of force had been
ineffective, his level of resistance had increased since the initial contact and was escalating and I was
still trying to affect a detention...affect an arrest...and lower levels of force were ineffective and I
believe I needed to transition to another use of force.”

I asked Wang if he believed Okobi was a danger to himself or the community and he replied, “Yes, him
running in the roadway represented a danger to himself, a danger to the community...and in addition to
committing the crimes (resisting arrest), establishing his mental wellbeing was a factor...and there
maybe the criteria to justify a mental health detention or mental care for an altered state of mind.”

SUPPLEMENT 12 - Interview of Deputy Joshua Wang

Upon further questioning about being struck in the face, Wang said he believed Okobi had struck him
with his hand, knocking Wang to the ground. Wang said, “I remember feeling a force over my body,
pushing me in some direction.”

I spoke to Wang about his trying to punch Okobi after he had been punched and knocked to the ground.
Wang believed he missed Okobi with both punches, saying he felt no pain in his hand then or today,
adding, “The fact that I don’t feel any pain in my hand at all makes me think that I must not have
connected with him.” I asked him for his justification for trying to punch Okobi in the face and he
replied, “At that point I had utilized physical control which was ineffective in terms of control holds, I
had utilized my Taser which was ineffective, I had utilized my baton which was ineffective, partly
because I missed, and at that point I didn’t have any other force options...I felt like all of his actions and
aggressions was specifically towards me and I felt a sense of hopelessness...(He thought) I don’t know
what I have to do to get him restrained...” He recalled again someone was “tugging” on his duty belt
after he was down, but “I don’t know if he was grabbing at my gun.” He later added he was unsure if it
was Okobi that was tugging at his belt.

I asked Wang when if ever he feared for his safety and he replied, “I felt like I couldn’t stop him...it was
a sense of hopelessness, a sense of fear.” Wang admitted his memory of what happened after being
punched in the head was “cloudy”.

I asked Wang what he meant earlier in the interview when he said that Okobi was “writhing back and
forth” after being handcuffed. He clarifed, “He was still moving...still moving his body around...still
requiring us to maintain active control of him...once the handcuffs went on it wasn’t like he
immediately surrendered.” I asked if Okobi’s breathing was ever restricted and he replied, “No.”

Lasked Wang specifically if a carotid restraint or headlock was ever used on Okobi and he replied, “No.”
He added, “Neither myself nor any other deputy had any hand near his face or neck other than when I
tried to punch him (and missed).”

Iasked Wang if he was injured as a result of the altercation. He said his right knee is “sore and stiff”, his
neck is “sore”, has face hurts (there was a visible injury presumably from being punched) and he had
pain to his right wrist. He explained that he was treated and released from the hospital in about an hour.

I asked Wang if he had previously deescalated other situations using his CIT training. He recounted an
incident about a month ago when a female had attacked her mother and he was able to build a rapport
with her verbally, allowing the female to be placed on a 5150 W&I hold without further incident or
physical altercation.

I asked Wang when he was qualified to carry the Taser since joiing the SMCSO and he said it was

SUPPLEMENT 12 - Interview of Deputy Joshua Wang
about a month ago after an 8 hour training course presented by a department Taser instructor.

At the conclusion of the interview, I asked Wang if he wanted to add anything that perhaps we had not
yet spoken about. He paused and said, “It’s not something that you can answer but it’s just what’s going
on in my head. I just can’t figure out why this happened. I don’t know why he (Okobi) did that. I don’t
know anything about him. I’ve never seen him before, never had any prior contacts with him. I don’t
know if he did it...I just don’t know why it went to shit so quickly and why it turned out like this...there
was no communication between me and him. It would be easier to understand (what happened) if he just
said ‘fuck you’.” Wang seemed at a loss to understand the reason behind Okobi’s behavior and his
physical resistance to the deputies involved in the event.

So then, uh, I have to do the math. So in terms of being a sworn police officer,
how many years has it been for you?

Uh, a little over five.

Nothing - nothing abnormal. Um, talk about what happened the shift before.
Things that are going on in the Millbrae - in our - in our patrol area. Any, uh,

emails the captain sent out. Um, nothing - nothing abnormal.

Okay. And let me back up for your over-time shift. Anything significant
happen during that shift?

No.

Any - any significant use of force? Any stressful - high stress calls?

No.

Nothing out of the ordinary? Okay. Uh, so regarding the incident we’re going
to talk about from morning briefing to that. Anything significant happen
there? Any calls out of the - you know anything unusual? High stress? Any
use of force?

Um, earlier - prior to the incident in question. Um, another deputy requested a
code 3 cover, so I responded code 3 - which is lights and sirens. Um, and a
most expedient manner. Um, code 3 driving is not extremely rare, but it’s also
- I don’t - but it’s also not a daily routine.

Okay.

So, um, that was kind of significant.

Okay any other - any other notable calls you handled before this? During -
during yesterday’s shift?

No.

mind?

Um, no. My wife and I have some vacation planned so I was lookin’ forward
to those. I was kind of, you know?

Counting the days.
Counting the days and hours, yeah.

Fair enough. Okay. And now, uh, where were you, um, when you got, um,
where were you just before this incident started. Like the last call you handled
or the last proactive thing you did. Whatever it was.

Um, the last call prior to the incident would have been probably much - much
earlier in the morning. There was - there was a big lag in terms of calls for
service. I responded code 3 to assist another deputy, and I don’t believe I
handled - I don’t believe I handled any other service up until the incident.

Okay - okay. So now this is the point in the - the discussion so I’m going to let
you - in your mind’s eye, whatever you decide that is for the time frame of
this. I want you to start when - in your opinion when this incident began.

Okay.

I want you to walk me through kind of a narrative, um, portrayal of what
happened.

Okay.

Up until the point when you would consider it to be over, or done or you
know, when it ended essentially for you.

Okay.

Okay.
Uh, if you miss something, feel free to back up.
Okay.

Just tell me you’re backing up so I can keep track of the chronological, uh,
events. Again, don’t pay attention to me keeping notes.

Okay.

And if at any point again you feel you need to confer with council, let me
know and we’ll take a break, and you can step outside. Okay?

Okay.
Okay. Go ahead.

Um, I was driving mark patrol vehicle number 10. It’s not my usual patrol
vehicle. My usual patrol vehicle is car number 3. That’s a marked Ford
Taurus. Um, but that - my - my regular patrol vehicle had been sent to the
shop for maintenance, so I was driving marked patrol vehicle number 10. It’s
a Ford Explorer. Um, I was logged into the MDT. I was logged into the - the
MAV device. The - my microphone was activated. Everything was as it
should be. Um, I was driving south bound on El Camino Real in Millbrae
approaching the intersection of El Camino Real and Millwood when I started
approaching the intersection, I saw someone, which looked to me like a male.
Um, walking east bound on Millwood through - crossing El Camino across,
um, three lanes of traffic. And from my perspective, it looked like the male
had stepped into the intersection, almost walking into the intersection of
Millwood and El Camino Real. Um, when he was not permitted to do so and I
base that upon the fact that, I saw a green light facing me making - leading me
to believe that I could lawfully proceed through the intersection. Um, and
there was a pedestrian standing in the road way at the time. Um, as I got closer
to the intersection, the subject stepped onto the median. Um, and I - I was
almost adjacent to the suspect. Um, just sort of based upon my observed, uh,
my observation that this person may have violated the California vehicle code,
and in that I was not assigned to a call for service, and I was in patrol, in my
assigned beat. Um, I decided that I would make a traffic enforcement stop of
that subject and contact him. Um, I activated my overhead emergency lights,
so I could conduct a U-turn and safely without, uh, getting struck by cars
traveling north bound on El Camino Real. Once the intersection was clear, I
made the U-turn and I pulled up alongside the same subject I had seen in the
road way. Um, he was walking north bound on El Camino Real, on the east
side of the sidewalk. Um, I saw that he was an African American male. Fairly

large in stature, holding numerous bags. Um, my usual approach into when I
want to stop pedestrians when I’m in a patrol vehicle is to pull up alongside
them, roll down my window and verbally contact them and let them know that
I intend to stop them and that - and that I need to talk to them. So I pulled up
alongside the subject, I rolled down my window and I said something along
the lines of, “Hey, I need to talk to you.” Or “Hey, stop hold on for a minute.”
Just let him know that he - I didn’t want him to continue walking. Um, he
continued to walk north bound on El Camino. Um, so I accelerated quickly to
give myself a little bit of a gap so I had time to pull my car over to the curb,
exit the vehicle, and approach the person before, um, and still give myself a
little bit of reactionary gap. Um, at that point after I accelerated, I saw the
subject continue to walk and he was now walking in the road way to my left,
and still walking north bound on El Camino Real. Um, I know El Camino
Real to be a, uh, heavily trafficked road way, with, um, multiple lanes of
traffic. Cars traveling at speeds of 35 miles per hour or more, typically. Um, at
that point I thought this - this simple detention had turned into something
more. I thought I was - I was bound to this subject now. I couldn’t just drive
away and say, “Hey, next time don’t do that.” I thought I can’t just drive
away. Now he’s walking in traffic. He may get struck by a vehicle. Um, he
may cause an accident. A car my swerve to avoid colliding with him. So I
continued to maintain a visual observation of the subject. Um, I notified
county communications that, um, I was trying to effect a stop of a pedestrian
and that - and that I would need additional help to do so. I didn’t think - I
didn’t think I would be able to safely stop the subject, while be mindful of
traffic flowing in both the northbound and southbound direction. Um, and so I
- I request another unit. The subject continued to walk in and out of traffic.
Still north bound on El Camino. Sometimes he would walk into the south
bound El Camino lane, sometimes he would walk on the median. Um, I could
see that cars were backing up. Cars were maneuvering to - maneuvering to
avoid hitting him, and he just continued to walk in traffic. It seemed he had no
regard for his own safety or the safety of the people that were in the roadway.
Um, after - after what I felt like was an extended period of time. I - it seemed
like he was gonna continue - continue walking in the road way. And, um, I
thought, now this is exigent public safety matter so I - I requested more - more
units to come code 3, as quickly as possible. Um, and this whole time my
overhead emergency lights were activated and I was - I was - some - someone
asked if I - dispatch asked if I was in pursuit of the subject. And at first I
didn’t know how to explain to them that I wasn’t in pursuit of him, and that I
was just trying to maintain a visual observation of him until more units could
arrive. Um, I didn’t want them to think it was some kind of, um, high speed
pursuit or anything like that. I just wanted to let them know. So I told them,
um, I wasn’t in pursuit of him. I wasn’t even behind him really at that point. I
was just kind of paralleling him and maintaining visual observation. Based
upon his behavior, this required me to conduct numerous U-turns on El
Camino - sometimes driving against traffic. Um, and at one point due to the -

the medians on El Camino I had to proceed northbound away from the subject
to the next intersection to make a U-turn so I could come back to keep a visual
of the - of the subject who was continuing to just walk in the road way. Um,
so as I - as I conducted a U-turn and started driving back southbound towards
the subject, I saw in the distance multiple emergency vehicles, which I
presumed were sheriff’s deputies come in code 3. I saw, um, I saw Deputy
Lorenzatti driving a Ford Taurus, which I know to be her regular vehicle. Um,
driving northbound in the south bound, um, - she was driving northbound, in
the southbound lanes of El Camino Real. I saw another - I believe a Ford
Taurus, which is - was another marked vehicle. Um, approach and I saw, um,
the subject walking southbound on El Camino, um, towards Deputy
Lorenzatti. And I saw Deputy Lorenzatti quickly exit her vehicle. I saw her
motioning with her hands, pointing to the ground, in a forceful manner. And I
believed that she was ordering the subject to, um, surrender and either place -
place the bags he was holding on the ground or place himself on the ground.
Um, while that was happening, I saw Deputy John DeMartini approaching the
subject. Um, I saw that the two of them were both physically smaller in size
then the subject. Um, I saw - and - and they were both shorter than the subject,
and they were significantly less - less heavy as the subject. Um, at that point I
- I became - I was - I became even more worried. Um, based on the subject’s
size, um, I thought that he may be able to physically over-power both Deputy
DeMartini and Deputy Lorenzatti if - if altercation came to, uh, escalated to
some type of physical altercation. I saw both Deputy Lorenzatti and
DeMartini standing there and the - the distance between them and the subject
was closing. Um, and based upon that I accelerated through kind of a sea of
cars to get closer, so I could get out of my car and assist them in detaining the
subject. Um, as - as I was getting closer, I saw them try - try and take physical
control of the subject. It looked like they were trying to grab the subject’s
arms in an attempt to control his hands. And I saw that he was able to over-
come their - their attempts to physically control him, and they were not able to
control his hands and he flung his arms in the air. Um, didn’t seem like there
was much they could do to stop him. So I exit my patrol vehicle. I ran towards
them. I try - I grab a hold of the subject’s right hand, and I tried to pull it
behind his back into a handcuffing position. Um...Once I believe that - once is
- if I can get his right hand behind his back, I could use, um, pain compliance
control hold. Like a bent wrist - bent wrist lock to, um, get him to comply and
put his left hand behind his back, and then we could handcuff him. I wasn’t
physically able to place his right hand behind his back, he was - he was - his
level of resistance was much stronger then my level of force, and I could tell
quickly that I wasn’t going to be able to physically gain control of him myself.
Um, at that point I thought, um, I need to create distance between myself and
him in order to protect myself because I’m not - I wasn’t physically able to,
uh, control him. Um, that - I felt - I - I was getting a little scared. Um, I felt
that, um, I’m not a big guy - I’m not a really strong guy, but in most of my
prior law enforcement encounters where I have to physically restrain

someone, I’m usually able to gain control of one of their arms, using both of
my arms. Um, so I thought I need to create distance and back away from him.
I stepped back. At this point he was still standing in the roadway of El Camino
Real. I thought I should try another force option beyond physical control and I
unholstered my holster, using my non-dominant hand. I deactivated the safety
of my Taser and shined the, um, the red dot - the flashlight - on his chest. Um,
and I told him, and I gave him a verbal command and said, “If - if you don’t
comply. Or if you don’t get on the ground, then you’ll get Tased.” My sole
purpose for wanting him on the ground was it may be easier to place him in
handcuffs and get control of his hands. Um, after I gave the verbal warning he
did not comply. He did not lower himself to the ground. Um, and I pulled the
trigger of my Taser and, um, shot him with my Taser. Um, I remember
hearing the pop sound from the Taser and I felt a lot of anticipation because I
was - I was hoping that it would work. I had never deployed a Taser on a live
person before. Um, and I hoped that it would - it would be enough to gain
compliance from him. Um, it seemed like it had some type of effect on him.
Um, I could tell that he felt some discomfort, um, I think he fell to the ground
at that point. And I notified dispatch that we had deployed a Taser and I
wanted to keep the radio channel clear in case we needed to broadcast
emergency traffic. I believe I requested a - a medic to stage due to our policy
and due to the fact that he may be injured as a result of the Taser deployment.
Um, once he was on the ground other deputies had arrived on scene, um, I
could see that they were trying to get physical control of his hands, try to get
him to place his hands behind his back. They were unsuccessful, and I believe
that the Taser prongs were still attached to the subject, and I ordered him
again to get on the ground - to get on his stomach, so we could place him in
handcuffs. He refused to comply, and I activated my Taser for a second time.
Um, I broadcast to dispatch, just to keep them continually apprised to what
was going on. That he was continuing - continuing to resist and I deployed my
Taser a second time. Um, at this point he was on his back, laying on - on the
roadway of El Camino Real. We were all, um, standing - standing around him
almost in a circle waiting for him to - my initial plan was that - at some point
he’s going to roll over onto his stomach into a prone position and with enough
people while he’s placed in that position we’ll be able to place his hands
behind his back and handcuff him, because that was my top priority. Um, he
refused to comply. I gave him more commands to roll over on his stomach. He
was still very much agitated. He was speaking incoherently. He was moving,
he was, um, very excited. And I deployed my Taser, um, for a third time.
While I was still giving him commands to roll over on his stomach and I - I
remember thinking I hope - I hope this is it - I hope this is the deployment - I
hope he realizes that - that we can’t just walk away. We can’t walk away, we
have to do something, and I hope that he would finally just give up and
surrender and say, “I’m going to do what they were telling me to do and roll
over on my stomach.” But, um, he refused to do it again. I saw - I think it was
deputy Bryan Watt grab his left arm and try to physically place his hand

behind his back. Um, he was trying to pull his arm away from Deputy Watt. I
could tell that he was still resisting at this point. And so I believe I deployed
my Taser a fourth time, and I notified dispatch. Um, he never gave any verbal
in- indications that he would submit. Um, he never made any physical
movements indicating to me that he was going to submit or comply with our
instructions. Um, and I could just - I remember hearing multiple people telling
him roll over. Get on your stomach - get on your stomach. He was eventually
able to get himself to his feet on his own. He stood up and he began to run
eastbound on E] Camino towards the northbound lanes of traffic. And at that
point, um, I thought that I - I thought that the Taser’s been totally ineffective.
Um, and there was no - and I am going to have to resort to another means of
force in order to detain him. Um, as he was running across El Camino I
transitioned to - I dropped my Taser. I transitioned to my baton. I - I expanded
my baton and I got closer to him, and I kept telling him, “Get onto the ground.
Get onto the ground.” He never - again he never made any verbal indicators
that he would comply. He never made any physical indicators that he would
comply. Um, and at this point I started thinking, how - how are we going to be
able to detain this guy? Um, he’s - we’ve all seen - I’ve seen first-hand how -
how physically strong he is. He wasn’t - I never felt any point up until now or
at any point during the whole incident that there was any window of
opportunity to sort of engage in some like CIT training, or engage him in
dialogue. He never really acknowledged who we were or acknowledged that,
um, he may be open, um, to trying to work this out verbally. Um, so I
expanded my baton. I told him to get on the ground. He refused to comply. I -
I swung my baton, I was aiming for his knees, um, and I swung it with my
right - I had the baton in my right hand. I swung it, um, swung the baton
towards him. I missed, and at that point, I felt him tackle me after I missed. He
had almost used the opportunity in which I was not facing him to grab onto
me and kind of pull me to the ground. Um, while he did that, I saw something
out of the corner of my eye, and I felt like a hot stinging pain on - on the left
side of my face. Um, I didn’t black out, but I knew something had hit me on
the face. Um, and now he - now - at this point he was on the ground and I was
on the ground. Um, I could feel that, uh, I felt that he was pulling on my duty
belt. And I felt - I felt my waist and the bottom half of my body almost being
pulled in one direction. And I didn’t know what he was trying to do. Um, I
had a friend who worked for the San Francisco Police Department who was
physically over-powered in a similar situation, and, uh, my friend me told me
that, you know, he thought he may have to shoot the person that was attacking
him. And the thought came into my mind that, um, if he reaches for my gun I
may be - I might be in a very bad situation in which, I’m on the ground and
he’s physically stronger than me. Um, I felt scared knowing that I couldn’t - I
couldn’t stop him. I was trying as hard as I could to just get him to comply,
and nothing I had done so far leading up to this had made him change his
behavior or made him acknowledge my presence or - or the fact that he - he
needed to listen to what we were telling him to do. Um, I - I - I tried to stand

up, and I know I struck him in the head - or I decided I was going to punch
him. So stood up. I remember swinging my fist towards his head twice. And I
- [remember the motion of swinging my fist, but I don’t remember ever
feeling anything coming into contact with my fist. And I don’t - I wasn’t sure
if I actually hit him or I missed - or if I hit and through all the adrenaline, I
didn’t even realize that my hand, uh, even contacted him. That still didn’t get
him to comply, um, I was pulling on his arms trying to put his hands behind
his back. I heard other - I know other deputies were nearby. They were trying
to do the same thing. Um, and I still felt he was trying to resist, um, I wasn’t
sure if he was going to try and pull at my belt again. At that point I used my
right hand, I reached down. I withdrew my, uh, OC spray. Um, I looked at
him. I saw I had a clear view of his face, and I deployed a | second burst of,
uh, OC spray to his face. Um, immediately upon deploying the OC, um, I
heard other deputies scream in pain. I didn’t hear him scream in pain, I didn’t
see any indication that he felt pain or discomfort as a result of that. Um, I felt
some splash back into my face. Remember hearing someone say, “Stay in it.
Stay in it.” And I - I put my OC spray back into the holder. Um, and at some
point, I - I - at some point I remember looking or standing up and seeing that
he was handcuffed. And I don’t - I don’t know who placed him in handcuffs. I
knew that they weren’t my handcuffs that were on him. Um, in that he was
now - his hands were restrained behind his back, but he was continuing - and
he was on his stomach in a prone position and he was continuing to move - or
writhe his body back and forth. And I remember still someone saying, “Stay
on him - stay on him.” And I thought that someone else observed that if we
didn’t try to hold him down that he was going to be able to get up again. So I -
I was kneeling down, I was holding on - now I was on the left side of his
body. I was holding his left arm down. Um, I heard other deputies saying that
they had been pepper sprayed, and that they had felt the effects. And I
thought, okay now that we had finally got him in handcuffs, but he’s still
continuing to move his body around. He’s still so - so strong that we can’t - I
thought, you know, this is the best we can do. Just hold him until maybe more
help arrived. Um, uh, I remember someone asking check for a pulse, make
sure he’s breathing. I started to but someone else - I saw someone else’s hand
go up to this, um, carotid artery. They said, “Yeah. He’s still breathing. He’s
still fine.” I heard him making noises, um, and so I - I took - I wasn’t listening
to radio traffic at that point, so I took - I decided I was going to make sure that
medics were coming. Um, grant- seeing as how, um, I had Tased him, I had
punched him, I had tried to hit him with my baton and I pepper - or OC
sprayed him. Um, I wanted medics to get in there and make sure he was okay
based upon all that force that we had just, um, affected on him. Um, dispatch
told me medics were on the way. I remember looking up and to see if cars
from - trying to proceed north on El Camino. I don’t remember seeing any -
any flashing red lights. Um, I was getting frustrated, um, I looked - I looked to
my left at that point to look at southbound traffic. I remember not seeing any
red lights or an ambulance, and I was - I was getting so frustrated because I

had thought I had requested an ambulance or medics right after I had Tased
him, and it felt like a whole 5-10 minutes had gone by since - since then, and
there were still no medics on scene. Um, at that point we rolled the subject
over while he was handcuffed onto his side. Um, someone said check for a
pulse again, someone checked they said he - he still - he still has a pulse. Um,
we sat him up, um, we sat him up. I was using my left knee and another
deputy was using their body or their knee to hold him upright. Um, other
deputies were using water to flush out their eyes. Someone was passing out
towels. Um, and someone told me, “Hey, Josh. Go sit down.” And I sat - there
was a - a pick-up truck. Uh, the tailgate was pulled down, so I sat down on the
truck. Um, I was physically exhausted. I could - I couldn’t even really speak.
People were talking to me and I - I responded. I didn’t know why, but my
voice was just very low in volume. Um, and I just felt sort of a whole wave of
emotions going through me like, um, like I was trying - trying to process
everything that just happened. And - and, um, I went back to the person - or
the subject. I think I helped hold him up a little bit longer. Um, I - everything
else was kind of a whirlwind. I don’t remember when the medics got there. I
remember looking and seeing that they were doing CPR on him and I thought,
that’s not good. He - you know. If they’re doing CPR on him he may - he may
have lost his pulse and was in physical distress, and I started to think, um, I
started to think if the medics had gotten their sooner, this wouldn’t have
happened. Um, and then someone told me, “Dude you’re bleeding.” And I
didn’t realize I was bleeding, and then I walked by a car on scene and I
remember looking in the reflection. I remember seeing blood on the left side
of my face. And I - I just thought I - I can’t believe what just happened. I can’t
believe that - that this guy now needs CPR. I had gotten hurt and I was just
sort of in disbelief about what had happened. Um, and then I went into -
someone told - I went into an ambulance. Um, some people were saying get
your picture taken. You need to have your picture taken. You need to go to the
hospital. Um, so I went in the ambulance, and there was a lot of people trying
to figure out what to do, and then I eventually - someone said take off your
duty belt. Take off your uniform, you’re gonna go to the hospital. So I did
that. I gave it to Sergeant Trickett. The ambulance took me to the hospital,
um, let me go back. Prior to leaving for the hospital someone asked what
hospital are you taking him? Someone said Peninsula I think, and they said oh
the - the subject’s there. And they made it sound like I shouldn’t go there, and
I didn’t quite understand why. Um, I didn’t - I didn’t quite understand why. I
thought if he needs medical care, send him to the best hospital. If I need
medical care, send me to the best hospital or the closest hospital. Just get - get
me to the hospital, get him to the hospital. I don’t - I don’t see what the
problem is. I don’t know why we’re kind of fussing over where we go. Um, so
then I said, I don’t have a problem with it. Just take - take me to the hospital.
So then they took me to the hospital. Um, I went there, doctor said I needed
some small stitches on my face. Told them about my injuries. Um, then at
some point a bunch of Sheriffs Deputies and Sergeants came in. They just

said they just wanted to check on me, make sure I was doing, okay. Um, and
then, uh, I was told that the DSA had gotten rooms at the Weston, and I
wasn’t sure why we would need to go to the Weston but, um, but my DSA rep
drove me to the Weston. Met with the attorney’s, um, my wife came. Talked -
talked to people. They - they all asked if I was feeling okay. Um, and then that
- that’s when it really set in that - that - that person had - the subject had died.
Um, no one at the hospital would tell me, um, so then it really set in that okay,
this is a homicide. And so we kind of made arrangements about the scheduling
and things like that. And then, uh, I went home and that was the conclusion of
the incident.

Okay. Thank you. Okay. Uh, I know that was kind of involved for you. Do
you need to take a break?

I’m - I’m all right.

Okay. Just checking... Okay, so let me walk you back a little bit to the
beginning and we’ll gradually make our way thought this. So you started
saying you were in a marked patrol vehicle. You’re in car 10 it’s a Ford
Explorer. In what way is it marked?

It’s, uh, painted black. The doors are painted white, um, it says Sheriff
alongside - both sides of the care. Um, I think it’s in reflective lettering too.
Below that it says San Mateo County in black, block letters. Back of the car
has a sheriff logo and says sheriff.

Okay.

And it has, uh, emergency lights.

Okay. Now put me in your perspective. If I’m southbound on ECR coming to
Millwood. Okay? And I’m looking out your windshield...

Mm-hm.

Okay? Which direction out - if I’m you - or you want to show me and I’ll
mirror you. Which way do you see him first?

So, um...
And don’t worry about north or south...
Okay.

..Just straight perspective.

I saw him walking from my right to my left.
Okay. So he’s walking from your right to your left?
Right.

Would you eventually at that moment get close enough to see his face, uh, in
any way where you could, like, describe him?

No.

Okay. Uh, at any moment do you recognize him from anything before this?
No.

Okay. Do you remember any prior contact with him?

No.

No? Remember seeing him on any alert, TRAK flier, anything?

No.

Okay. So from this point of contact, you believe this is someone you’ve never
had contact before?

Correct.

Okay. Uh, have you since heard his name?

No.

Okay. You said - so you see him, he goes from your right to your left...
Correct.

And you said you pulled beside him. Okay what do you mean by that?
Where’s your car I relationship to him?

So [had - by that point now I was facing a - a red signal light, so I was
stopped at - directly in the number one lane at the intersection of El Camino

Real and Millwood, heading southbound.

Mm-hm.

He was now standing on the median that divides northbound and southbound
El] Camino.

Okay. So you’re at the red light, where is he in relationship to you?
To my left.

Okay so he’s right here?

Maybe not directly to my left, but maybe at my 7 o’clock - 8 o’clock position.
Okay. So he’s out - he’s out your driver’s side window?

Correct.

Okay. How far away you think he is?

Uh, maybe 5 to 10 feet.

Okay. So now you’re waiting there to make a U-turn?

Correct.

Okay. So you make a U-turn...

Correct.

Now you’re coming back. Do you remember what he does next, in terms of
what direction he goes next?

After I had made the U-turn he was walking on the sidewalk, northbound on
El Camino Real. And I positioned - I pulled my patrol vehicle over to the right
alongside the curb, so I could be alongside him.

Okay. And this is after the U-turn?

Correct.

Okay. It’s at that moment in your statement you said, “I thought it was
something more.” Explain to me - expand on that for me.

Uh, I didn’t say I thought it was something more at that point. I rolled down
my window...

Okay.

And I told him, “Hey I have to talk to you for a minute.” I wanted to make
verbal contact with him.

Okay. What - what, if anything, does he indicate that he heard you or
recognize you or he - does he do anything to acknowledge your presence?

No.

Okay. Does he make eye contact with you?

I don’t remember.

Okay. That’s a perfectly good answer. Um - um, does he ever - when you’re -
do you remember exactly order you gave him? Like I just need to talk to you.
Or did you give him any with you - as you would describe as a - a lawful
order that, you know, he’s being detained?

I think - I think I said, “Hey stop. I got to talk to you.”

Okay. Are your lights on?

Yes.

Okay. Um, and then - maybe that was when you start thinking this is
something more.

Right.
Expand on that for me.

Um, based on the fact that he - he didn’t make any acknowledgement that he
heard me or that he was going to comply...

Mm-hm.

..and he continued to walk. That’s why I thought it might be something more.
Okay. And what do you mean by that?

More than just a simple pedestrian stop.

Where I pull alongside, I give them a command, I tell them to stop or they
stop. And then I exit my car and contact them.

Okay. What - what is your opinion of his demeanor at that point? Do you feel
like he’s evading you? He’s not paying attention? He didn’t hear you? What
do you think’s happening? If you had to speculate about his end of it.

My speculation would be based on some prior experiences in which the same
thing has happened.

Mm-hm.

Um, when I pull up alongside someone and tell them I need to talk to them -
in prior law enforcement experience, I’ve had people that continue walking
and they don’t stop right away. And my - what I typically do is, I accelerate
my car rapidly and I pull up alongside the curb ahead of them, so I have time
to get out of the car and try and contact them in person, not from inside my
vehicle.

Okay.
So that’s what I tried to do with him when he continued to walk.
Okay. And what did he do that prevented that contact from happening?

What...so I accelerated my car and I pulled up alongside the curb and I saw at

that point that he had walked from the - the sidewalk - the eastern sidewalk of
El] Camino Real. Walked onto the lanes of traffic of El Camino Real. And now
he was walking on the median of El Camino.

Okay. And then I think it’s that moment that you decided that, um, you were
gonna call for some more units.

Correct.

Okay. And in to regards to that subject, what is it about his physical demeanor
that you - you flip a switch and realize, “I’m gonna need more units?”

It - one it was based upon the fact that he was physically large in stature. That
was - that was one aspect. Two - the second was that he was holding multiple
bags in his possession. And I didn’t know - I didn’t know what was in the
bags. And three it was based upon the fact that he - in my opinion - at this
point he had made pre-indicators that he was gonna try and evade me.

Mm-hm.

And not allow himself to be detained.

Okay. Um, so then you describe how - I guess - I think you’re in your car and
you see DeMartini and Lorenzatti, and now he’s going towards them?

This was after I had conducted numerous U-turns and...

Right - right.

...was broadcasting...

Right.

Yeah.

So then you said he’s going towards them.

Correct.

Are they in their cars?

At this point I was driving southbound on El Camino.

Okay.

I saw their - their marked patrol vehicles approach, with their lights and sirens
on. And I saw them stop their vehicles. I saw both of them exit their vehicles,
and I saw that he was continuing to walk towards them.

Okay.

Um, and that’s when I saw Deputy Lorenzatti motioning with her hands,
making quick moments with her hands. It almost looked like she was pointing
to the ground or pointing at him, like she was trying to emphasize what she
was telling him.

Okay. As far as you can tell, is he looking at her?

Yes.

Okay, in relationship to her. She’s - she’s out of her car, correct?

Um, her car was parked alongside - she was facing northbound in the
southbound lanes of traffic. So her car is facing the wrong direction...

Mm-hm

And her car was next to the sidewalk.

Okay and his line of sight, can he see her and her car?

The subject?

Yeah.

Yes.

Okay. And you said her lights were on?

Correct.

And - and, um, DeMartini’s lights were on? Best you can recall.
I don’t remember if his lights were on.

Okay. And how far away are you when this interaction is happening?
Um, I would guess 30 - 30 feet?

And it sounds like his back is to you?

Correct.

Okay, can you see any physical acknowledgement on his part that he is
recognizing their presence?

No.

Okay. Does he - he just keeps walking towards them?
Yes.

Okay. Still with the bags in his hand?

Correct.

Correct.

Okay. What if any orders are you giving him when you make that first

I don’t recall. My typical response is, put your hands behind your back.

Okay. You made a comment that he - he easily over-came. Okay. Tell me
what you mean by that. Expand. What - what did he physically do?

So my intention was to grab his right wrist or arm and wrist and pull his right
wrist behind his back.

Mm-hm.

When I say that he easily overcame that. I mean that he didn’t allow me to
move his arm behind his back.

No it was more my chest towards his right shoulder.
Okay. And so you used one hand or both hands?
Both hands.

Okay and what - what does he physically do? Does he pull against you? Does
he pull away from you?

He - he pulled against me. He pulled - he pulled his arm out of my grasp.

Okay. And if you remember, as you do that. Where is - where is the other two
off- the two deputies?

I believe they were on the other side towards his left shoulder.

Okay.
..I presume...
That’s fine.
..place his hands behind his back.
Okay. And then shortly after that is when you try?

Correct.

Okay. Um, and you - you make the decision you have to handcuff him. Okay
what - what is the nature or the reasoning behind handcuffing him?

I wanted to handcuff him because based upon my observations of him already
at this point, his behavior was unpredictable. He wouldn’t acknowledge any of
my commands. He had already - like I said earlier, displayed pre-indications
that he was going to try and evade detention by - by creating distance between
myself and him. Um, and based on his physical stature, um, I thought in order
to prevent him from escaping and creating more distance between us. In order
to prevent him from attacking us, I felt much safer having him in handcuffs
before we tried to engage in any type of meaningful...

Okay.
..dialogue.

So these two deputies are trying to control him. They’re not able to. You try to
control him. Is he walking or standing still when that’s happening?

He was standing still.

Okay. And - and he’s not - you don’t remember him saying anything?

No.

Okay. Um, do you remember any - other than the fact that he’s clearly pulled
against you and resisted. Do you have any other physical, uh, signs that he’s
aware of the presence of you and the other two deputies?

No.

Okay. Um, and then you said, you could tell immediately, “I could not control
him”

Correct.

Okay. Expand on that please.

Just based on the ease in which he was able to pull from my grasp, um, I - I
based on that I thought, I’m not gonna be able to hold on to his arm. He’s not
gonna allow me to place - I - would not be able to physically over power him

into placing his arm behind his back.

Okay. Um, is it clear to you how much - it sounds like you’re aware that’s
he’s bigger then you.

Correct.

Is it clear to you - more clear when you get up close to him? Or did you know
all along?

I knew prior to physically contacting him how big he was. I radioed to
dispatch a description of him before I - before any other units had even arrived
on scene.

Okay.

And I described him as, a 6 foot male, about 250 pounds.

Okay. And you gave him an order or - a warning at least that you were going
to - you were going to tase him.

Correct.

Okay. Do you see any physical reaction to that order?
No.

Does he say anything?

Not that I recall.

Okay. When you give that order. Is he looking at you or any of the other
deputies?

I don’t know if he was looking at me, but he was facing me.

His body was directed towards me. I had a clear view of his chest.

Okay so he - you don’t remember where his gaze was, but you’re face to face?
His body - right.

And how far away are you?

I would approx- um, between myself and the door. So I would guess that’s
about eight feet.

Okay. When you give that warning, is he standing still or is he still walking?

I believe he was walking southbound on El Camino in traff- in the lane of
traffic.

Okay. Uh, what are the dep- the other two deputies doing when he’s doing
that and you’re giving this order, if you remember?

I don’t - I don’t remember what they were doing.

Okay. Um, and then you activate the Taser the first time.
Correct.

And by that you mean you fire the probes.

Correct.

Okay. What is his physical reaction to that?

His physical reaction was - I saw his body tense up, and I think he fell to the
ground.

Okay. Do you remember seeing any visual confirmation of where the probes
if they both - if they both contacted or what your spread was at all?

No.
Okay. Um, what model Taser do you have?
It’s a X26.

five second activation.

Correct.

Okay. So - and it’s not the model. It’s the X26 original that has one set of
probes.

Correct.

Okay.

Yeah.

Do you carry a second set of probes on it?

No.

Okay. Um, so then you said I could tell he was feeling discomfort.
Right.

Tell me what that - what do you mean by that?

When I saw - when his body tensed up, I could tell that it was having some
type of effect on him.

Okay and you - and you believe he fell to the ground?

I think so.

Okay. Um, and then, uh, you said the - the deputies then tried to control him.
Correct.

Okay. Then it sounds like there were some more officers coming at that point?

Um, at this point, he was not allowing the other deputies to place his arms
behind his back.

Okay. Like it looks like he’s pulling against them?

Yes.

Okay now. Leading up to the second time when you gave him orders - did you
give him orders before you activated the Taser a second time?

Yes.

And by the second time you mean you’re going to pull the trigger again on the
already deployed probes?

Correct.
Okay. What I missed in there was did he get back up?
No.

Okay. So he’s down on the ground. He’s physically resisting at least two
deputies.

Uh, yes.

Okay. Do - do you remember giving another warning of any kind?
Yes.

Okay. And what was that?

It was “get on your stomach now.”

Okay. Do you remember how many times you said it? Or if you said anything
else?

I don’t - I know I said it at least three times. At least three or four times.
Okay.
And I may have said, “Or you’re going to get tased again.”

Okay. So you pull the trigger a second time.

Correct.
Okay. Now on the X26, once the Taser darts are deployed if you hold that
trigger - if you just pull it, it’1l do five seconds. If you hold it - it will keep
going. Do you remember which one you did?

I pulled it and I released my finger.

Okay. And was he...do you remember him being on the ground when that
happens?

Yes.

Okay. What physical reaction do you recall to that second deployment?
Nothing.

Nothing? Okay what’s he - do you remember him doing anything? Does he

show any of the discomfort in that second deployment that he showed in the
first?

So - upon watching the MAV video...
Okay.

...So this isn’t from my recollection. It’s from watching the MAV video. He
says, “The word of God. Get them out of me.”

Do you have any conscious recollection for that second deployment if the
probes are still on his person or - or in a position to be effective?

No.

Okay. But from that - from that - and I appreciate you clarifying. So you see
in the second one you deployed it. He says, you know, “Word of God get
them out of me.” Um, and sitting here we don’t know what he’s referring to.

But you - you don’t recall seeing a physical reaction in his demeanor that he’s
reacting to that second deployment?

No.

Okay. Um, So then you said you can see he’s agitated, but he’s speaking
incoherent.

Right.

1581

1582. Q: Okay. Expand on that for me.

1583

1584 A: Um,

1585

1586 A: .... could tell that he - he wasn’t comfortable. He wasn’t - he didn’t want to
1587 allow anyone to touch him or restrain him.

1588

1589 Q: Okay. I’m going to stop you. What do you mean? What - what - what - after
1590 that second deployment are you or any of the deputies doing anything else to
1591 physically control him?

1592

1593 A: Deputy Watt tried to grab his left arm and place it behind his back.

1594

1595 Q: Okay. Is he still on the ground? By that I mean the subject not Watt.

1596

1597 A: Yeah.

1598

1599 Q: Is he still on the ground after that second deployment?

1600

1601 A: I believe so, yes.

1602

1603 Q: Okay. And he’s still physically resisting?

1604

1605 A: Correct.

1606

1607. Q, Okay, um, and - and you can tell he’s agitated. Okay how would you - I know
1608 it’s not incoherent. But how would you describe his - a- a- audibly what is he
1609 saying? What’s it sound like?

1610

1611 A: At the time I didn’t know what he was saying. Upon watching the video, now
1612 I know he was saying, “Get them out of me. The word of God.”

1613

1614 Q: Okay. Um, so now you’re making the decision. You’re going to be using the
1615 Taser a third time.

1616

1617. A: Correct.

1618

1619 Q: Prior to that, do you have any confirmation yet, at that point, if the Tasers -

I don’t.
No idea. Okay. Remember seeing your wires at all?
No.

Okay. So prior to the third deployment, do you remember - approximately
how far away is he from you?

Um, I would guess maybe 6 to 8 feet.

Okay. And is he still down on the ground?

Correct.

Okay. Do you - did you give any kind of warning before the third use?
Yes.

Okay and...

It was get on your stomach or you'll get tased again.

Okay. And what is his body position on the ground just before that third one?
He’s on his back.

He’s on his back?

Yeah.

Okay. What’s he - is - is - what’s he - what’s - what’s - what’s the motion of
his limbs if anything? What’s he doing while he’s on his back?

He’s - he’s moving.

Mm-hm.

But I don’t know if what - what his intentions were. It wasn’t, uh, it wasn’t a
motion in which I thought he might be trying to comply with my

..and roll over on his stomach.
Okay. So when you’re making the decision that you might have to use this a
third time, is he doing something you recall with this limbs, that he’s still
resisting those officers on scene and - and - and you? Do you remember is he
kicking anybody? Or is he flailing? What’s he doing? If anything.
I think he was flailing.

Okay. Um, so then you make the decision you’re going to do the third
deployment. Okay? So you gave a similar warning?

Correct.

Okay. And same thing. Did you pull and release?
Pull and release, yeah.

Okay. What’s his physical reaction to that?

I think he started getting up.

He started getting up?

From the ground.

Okay. So he’s - he’s under his own power?
Under his own power.

No - no one’s - no one’s lifting him up. He’s starting to get up.
Correct - correct.

Is he getting up and - and don’t - don’t guess.
Right.

Is he getting up during that 5 second activation? Or just shortly thereafter? Or
so close does it look like it’s as he’s getting up?

I couldn’t tell if it was during the activation or if it was after.

Okay. Do you see any of that - what you spoke of. That - that physical sign of
discomfort for that third activation?

I don’t remember.

Okay. So he starts to get up. Does he get up?

Yes.

Okay. In that part. Your mind’s eye for there. Can you see your wires? Do you
see your wires anywhere? Do you have any idea if your probes are still
engaged?

I saw wires, but I couldn’t see where they were attached to.

Okay.

I saw wires from my gun - or the Taser...

Right gun...

My Taser.

I got you.

I saw copper wires and they were leading and there was just a clump of them
and I couldn’t tell what they were attached to.

Okay. Could you tell if they were still attached to him?
I could not.

You could not. Okay. But he’s not giving you any visual interpretation that
he’s going to comply in anyway.

No.

So he gets up.

Yes.

Is he saying anything?
No.

Uh, his demeanor was still uncompliant.

And what do you mean by that?

Um, his body language never indicated to me that he was surrendering or
giving up.

Okay. After the fourth - excuse me third time, he gets up. Deputies around
him. Is anyone trying to go hands on?

I believe Deputy Watt and Sergeant Weidner were trying to go hands on at
that point.

Okay. Anybody else besides you or anyone any - stop that. Do you remember
at that point once he gets up, is there any more orders being given to him?

I don’t remember.

Okay. So now he gets up. You said he’s not complying.

No.

Okay. You think Watt and one other deputy tried to control him.
Correct.

Do you re- do you remember seeing him resist that effort after that third
deployment?

I don’t know if - yeah. I guess the short answer is yes, he resisted because I
never saw them place - I never saw them gain physical control over him.

Okay. So at some point you make a decision now that he’s back on his feet,
you’re gonna try the Taser the fourth time?

Yes.
Okay. So again, do you remember the distance he is away from you? At all?

I think he’s starting to create distance between ourselves. And I think he’s
starting to run eastbound on El Camino.

Okay. and are the - the other deputies are they following?

Okay. Do you remember them giving any orders or anything?
I remember they were yelling, but I don’t know what they were saying.

Okay. Um, so then, uh, you pulled the trigger a fourth- the trigger of your
Taser a fourth time.

I think so.

I- [ll back up. In fairness, I remember you said, I think I used the Taser a 4th
time.

Right.

And we’ll figure that out later. But do you remember - have any recollection
of whether you pulled the - the - the trigger a fourth time? Or better yet, at that
moment you think you did, do you remember seeing a physical reaction to
him being under - under the influence of the Taser?

No.

No.

And I'll add - this isn’t from my recollection. It’s from watching the video.

Thank you.

As he’s getting up and running, I hear the click - the distinctive noise of a
Taser and I hear someone saying, “Turn it off - turn it off.”

Okay.
Which makes me think that I did activate it a fourth time.

Okay. Um, probably - do you believe - think it’s another deputy saying turn it
off?

Yes. It - it wasn’t me.

Shortly after I had dropped the Taser.

Okay. And that is when he’s running eastbound?
Right. And I...

Okay. And you made another statement - I’m going to make you expand
again. You said there was no indication that he was going to comply.

Is that because he’s running eastbound?

Okay. Is he saying anything?

I don’t know.

Okay. And do you remember if anything - orders that - that were being given

Um, I completed the training, I got a certificate. Um...
And what is - how - how - what does that entail?
It - it - it - I believe it’s 40 hours or 80 hours, um, it’s a whole - it’s a
collection of different types of lectures and discussions and interactive
activities in which you learn more about people in crisis. More about people
with mental - mental disorders...

Mm-hm.

Um, you sort of learn - it kind of teaches you to slow things down and not be
in such a rush to - to any course of action.

Okay.

It kind of gets you to take a step back...

Did that training include role playing?

Yes.

Scenario based training?

Yes.

I know I missed.

You know you missed. Okay. And so you swing - swang it...swang it? You
swung it at his legs?

Correct.

Okay. One leg? Both legs?

Un, it - it was just towards the direction of his legs?

Okay. And what was your justification to using the baton?

My justification was, um, prior - prior uses of force had been ineffective.
Mm-hm.

His level of resistance had increased since the initial contact and - and was
escalating. Um, and I was still trying to effect a detention. At this point I was
trying to effect an arrest of the subject. And lower levels of force were

ineffective and I - and I believe I had to transition to another use of force.

What - what - why did you still feel the necessity - the legal necessity to
control him, detain him, stop his behavior?

At this point he had committed multiple crimes that I - in my presence.

And what were those?

Uh, he had resisted arrest. He had walked into the roadway. Um, there’s you
know - he had violated the California vehicle code. He had resisted arrest.
Um, and at this point it became a concern of mine as to why he was resisting.

Why he was refusing to comply.

Okay. Do you recall then making a determination he represented any kind of a
danger to anyone? Or you or the community?

Yes.
Okay. Expand on that for me.

Um, him running in the roadway in the very beginning presented a danger to
himself.

Okay.
Um, a danger to the community. Um, and there were - in addition to
committing the crimes, you know - establishing his mental well-being was
also a factor. Um, whether or not he met the...maybe the criteria for mental
health detention.
Okay.
Or required medical hair - medical care for being in an altered state of mind.
Okay. So - at risk of putting words in your mouth. At this point this is either
criminal or it could be a psychiatric emergency, but - in your mind - whatever
it is, there needs to be some physical detention of this subject?
Correct.
Okay. Um and then, uh, you said you - you - sounds like you moved in at
some point you closed ground on him and then you felt something hit you. do
you have any idea what hit you?
I believe it was his hand.

Right.
Okay but what - did you stay on your feet?
I think I fell to the ground.

Okay. And do you remember how you fell? Did you go backwards, face ...if
you know?

Um, I don’t remember.
Okay.

I remember just sort of feeling - feeling a force over my body. Pushing me in
some - some direction.

Okay. You did make a comment. You said you stood up - so I’m assuming
that’s - that’s - you - you remember standing up as you go to punch him?

I remember the punches were from - he was below me when the punch - when
I punched him.

Okay.

So I must have been in a position over him.

Okay. And you said you thought you tried to punch him twice?
Yes.

Was that with your...

Right hand.

Right hand. Okay. But you’re not sure if you hit him or not?
Correct.

Okay. How does your hand feel today?

Feel’s fine.

Okay. So sitting her now, do you have any idea whether or not you made
contact or not?

The fact that I don’t feel any pain in my hand at all, makes me think that I - I
must not have connected with him.

Okay.

I - I made the motions of punching, but...

Do you remember what part of his body you targeted?

His face.

Okay. And what was the nature of the justification for that?

At that point I had utilized physical control, which was ineffective in terms of
control holds. I utilized my Taser, which was ineffective. I utilized my baton,
which was ineffective. Partly because I missed, right? And at that point I
didn’t - I didn’t have any other force options to go to.

When - when you made the decision that you were gonna use, um, try to strike
him. Do you remember knowing then - did you know that he had punched
you? Or that he had in some way assaulted you?

Yes.

Okay. And tell me about your - your emotion- how you’re feeling emotionally
right there.

I felt - at that point I had felt like all of his - his actions and his aggression and
his resistance was specifically towards me at that point.

Okay.

I felt like he was targeting me. Um, and I - I felt a sense of hopelessness.
Okay.

I felt that I - I was - I felt - I felt frustrated - I felt hopeless - I felt like I don’t
know what I have to do to get him restrained. I don’t know what I have to do
to take this guy into custody.

Okay.

And I didn’t know - I was worried. I didn’t know how much longer this could
go on for. I had felt - you know right around - right after I had missed with the

baton and he - he brought me to the ground. I started feeling the tugging on
my belt. I could feel - it - it just felt like hands were on...around my waist
line. And I felt...

Could you tell what part of the belt he was tugging on?

I couldn’t.

Okay. And from the moment when you first used the Taser, until let’s say the
moment you realize he’s in handcuffs. Was there ever a time at all when you
were in fear for your safety?

Yes.

Okay and what - describe that for me.

I was sort of describing it earlier. I - I felt like I couldn’t - I couldn’t stop him.
I felt like...

So when you describe a sense of hopelessness it was that feeling...

Right. It was a sense of hopelessness. It was a sense of fear. It was a sense that
I - the thought - I mentioned earlier the thought crossed my mind of if - if he
keeps grabbing at my belt and I didn’t know if he was grabbing at my gun.
Okay.

And I...

I - go ahead.

I didn’t know he was grabbing at my gun. But I - I was thinking if - I was
getting really close to the point where I thought if he makes - if I see his hand
near my gun. Or I feel anything tugging at my gun, I’m going to shoot him.
Okay. Do you know for sure it was him pulling on your belt?

I don’t.

Okay. And then you made a comment. You said, I still felt he was trying to
resist. So, um, and then it sounds like from the time you were whatever -
punched whatever - let’s say you were punched. Let’s assume you were

punched. Um, there’s kind of a - it’s cloudy. Right?

It is.

Okay so now I’m gonna fast forward to something when you’re at the
hospital. What was the doctor’s determination of what - if any injuries you
suffered from the punch?

They - the doctors asked if “were you punched or scratched?”

Okay.

And I said, I don’t know.

Okay.

I said I know his hand was near my face. And I know that the singular attack
that I felt happened right after I swung my baton.

Okay.

That’s where I know it went from at most resisting to assaultive. Where he
actively picked me out of all the group of deputies and he came at me.

Okay. Do you ever feel like now from the time you got punched - was there -
did it - did it have a change in terms of your mental perception of what was
going on?

A little bit.

A little bit?

Yeah.

Okay. Um, and then you said you - somehow you realized he’s - he’s
handcuffed, and you don’t remember how that happened or who was able to
do it.

Right.

But in your minds eyes you see that he’s handcuffed.

Right.

Um, and you said he’s writhing back and forth. Explain that for me.

I remember he was still moving. Um, he was still moving his body around
while he was on his stomach. I remember hearing someone yelling, “stay on

Page 50
2206 him - stay on him - stay on him - stay on him”. And that made me think that
2207 he’s doing something that is still - that still requires us to maintain active
2208 control over him. It’s...
2209
2210 Q: Okay.
2211
2212 A: In - in that sense I thought that once the handcuffs went on, it wasn’t like he
2213 immediately surrendered.
2214
2215 Q: Okay.
2216
2217 A: Like he...
2218
2219 Q: I think this is when you said you - you - you yourself were trying to hold his
2220 left arm down.
2221
2222 ~—sA: Correct.
2223
2224 Q: And you made a comment like, “He’s so strong.”
2225
2226 =A: Right.
2227
2228 Q: What do you mean?
2229
2230 A: I remember thinking that - I mean even with his hands were strained, I was
2231 trying to hold his arm down. I was on my knees. I remember thinking he’s
2232 mo- I - I know he’s still moving and it’s still requiring a lot of force just to
2233 keep him in one spot.
2234
2235 Q: Okay. When he’s in the position, what position is his body in?
2236
2237 A: So he’s in the prone position.
2238
2239 Q: By that meaning chest down?
2240
2241 A: Chest down. Yeah.
2242
2243 Q: Okay. Was he still talking or making noise audibly?
2244
2245 A: I don’t recall.
2246
2247 Q: Okay. But is he still physically resisting you and anybody else that has their

Okay. And you don’t remember if he’s saying anything or anything like that?
No.

Okay. Was anything - do you recall any moment in there where his breathing
was restricted?

No.

Okay. Do you remember - and obviously we’re going to take statements from
them. Do you remember witnessing any other efforts or use of force
techniques by the other deputies to control him? Besides grabbing the arms...
Af- af- after that point? After he was handcuffed?

From - from - from first Tasering to, now he’s in handcuffs and he’s still
fighting against you. Anything else other then what you describe? Grabbing
for arms. Do you remember any other techniques that were used?

I believe Deputy Lorenzatti had her baton out at one point.

Okay.

I don’t know if she’s uti- utilized it or struck him with it.

Okay. Do you remember anyone else using any other control holds of any
kind? Or at least trying?

Yes. I don’t know which specific control hold they were trying to utilize, but I
know they were actively holding onto the subject.

And - and what part of his body?
His arms - his hands.

Okay. Do you remember any - anything, um, in terms for like, the neck up?
Do you remember anybody trying a carotid restraint? A head lock...

No.

Okay. Do you remember if anyone had any contact with his throat? Neck?

I didn’t see anyone have contact with his neck or throat. I don’t know if they
attempted to or not.

Okay. But you don’t remember anybody trying anything like...

Neither myself, nor any other deputy had any hand near his face or his neck.
Other - other then why I tried to punch him twice.

So that you - right. So the physical use - in terms of use of force from if you
look at the escalation...

Mm-hm.

What you remember is there was hands on. Trying to grab and control arms.
Um, you remember trying to control his legs at any point?

I didn’t see that. No.

Okay. And then, uh, you said when he’s down on the ground, when he’s chest
down this is when you realize, you know, how strong he is and he’s making
noises. What do you mean?

I heard him breathing.

Okay.

Um...

Do you remember seeing if his eyes were open or closed?

At one point his eyes were open.

Okay. In that - in that same moment?

Correct.

I think so.

Okay. Do you remember feeling him using any of his own strength or power
to sit himself up? Do you remember him participating in the process at all?

Just due to how heavy he was I - I don’t know.

Okay. So, but it sounds like he was able to sit up.

We...

Or you got him sit - sat...

Well, yeah. At one point he was sitting up.

Okay.

His - his butt was on the ground...

Okay.

His - his back and legs were at a 90 degree angle. Um...
Leg’s straight out? Knees bent? What do you remember?
I don’t - I don’t remember.

Okay. How about torso? Was he up straight? Leaning over?

Um, he was - I was having to use my left leg, and there was another deputy. I
don’t - I don’t remember who.

Okay. Is - is you left leg like on his back?
So - so my...
Are you holding him up?

Okay so do you - now I want you to go back. Do you remember the moment
for right here when he’s leaning against your back and he’s sitting up?
Yes.

Okay do you remember hearing him breathing? Do you remember hearing
him making noises?

I didn’t hear him breathing. I didn’t hear him making noises. I know someone
said check for a pulse. And I know someone said he’s still breathing.

Okay. When he’s on your knee, okay? Is he slumped over or is he sitting up?
Do you know whether or not he’s using any of his core strength to sit up?

I- I don’t know.

Okay. And when you’re using you knee is it - is his momentum back towards
you?

Yes.

Okay.

And that’s typical. I - I don’t think I’ve ever come across someone that can be
handcuffed with their hands behind their backs, sit on their butt and keep
themselves up right...

Okay.

... without needing some kind of support for their back.

Do you remember seeing his face at that time at all?

No.

Right.

Okay. Um, and then at some point how did you go from holding him up and
someone told you, “Hey you need to go sit down?”

Yeah.

And you go sit on the tailgate?

Yeah.

And you said it’s kind of hazy at this point?
Right.

Do - do you have any guess how long you’re sitting on that tailgate?

But at some point, you got off the tailgate, and you realize medics have started

Um, my right knee has a scratch. It’s pretty stiff. It’s kind of sore.
Okay.

Um, my neck is sore. Hurts turning my head left and right. Um, my face hurts
a little bit. Um, my wrist - my right wrist hurts. Um, that’s about it.

Okay. Um, and how were you - were you able to sleep last night?

Yeah.

Okay. How long were you treated at the hospital if you remember?

One hour maybe?

And | appreciate you during the interview clarifying what you saw verse what
you remember, but so I understand, um, prior to the interview and obviously
with your councilor you - you saw your own MAV video. Um, and then, um,
uh, you were able to view some photos that were takin with a civilian’s cell
phone. Ah, excuse me... video taken, but the audio was taken out, right?
Right.

And I’m telling you that because I took the audio out, but...

Okay.

Did you view any other videos beside that?

Um, no.

Okay. and other then since it happened. Um, other than your council have you
talked about it with anybody else or discussed it with anybody else?

No. Um, well I told my wife just generally what happened, just so...

Okay. Um, and I - I- asked you several times, but now just take a minute.
From what you remember from first contact to, let’s say when you were no
longer helping him sit up and you look over and CPR started. Do you
specifically remember anything he said? Anything he asked? Anything he

Right.
... The word of God take these out. Um, no.

Do you remember him having any, you know, reciprocal conversation? Any
two-way conversation with anybody?

No.

Okay. Um, and then, uh, for prior you said you had the prior CIT training?
Correct.

Um, you made a comment about how you never had a chance - and I think
that’s because how fast this evolved, but has there been prior instances where
your CI - CIT training you were able to de-escalate a situation?

Yes - yes.

Okay just give me. Just summarize one of those for me.

Uh, this happened within the last month. We went to a call of a - a - I think
she’s schizophrenic or bi-polar or maybe both. Um, a girl who attacked her
mom. Threw a chair at her, um, I went there I was the primary unit and - you
know, I eventually talked to her for, you know, and extended period of time. I
tried to form connections with her. Let her know I didn’t want to hurt her. I
wasn’t trying to get her in trouble. And we eventually got her to, uh, we
placed her in a mental health detention without any force or anything like that.
And she cooperated.

Okay. And that was from your verbal interaction with her?

Specifically, my verbal interaction with her.

Okay. And I - I - I know for a fact you didn’t have a Taser in San Francisco.

Correct.

Um, but I assume you’ve carried a Taser since you came to the Sheriff's
office?

No.

Um...

How long have you had the Taser? How long have you been certified or
qualified with carrying the Taser?

I want to say it’s probably been about - probably about a month.
Probably about a month?

Yeah.

And then what was the process to get to where you’re allowed to carry it?
Uh, I took training through the Sheriff's Office.

Okay.

Uh, it was taught by a Deputy who I think - I think took training from Taser.
Okay.

Um...

Do you remember how long the training was?

It was a day.

Okay. Was that, uh, was there some like class room about how it works? That

There’s a classroom about how it works...

Okay. Any - any video where you watched other incidents or anything
involving a Taser?

Yes.

Okay. I assume you went through, like, the precautions of the device and that
kind of thing.

Right.

Okay. Um, after you got - we think you got punched. It’s safe to say the
subject did something to strike you in the face. Is that...Okay? Uh, and you
said you - you felt the hot - the heat on your face. Do you remember feel dizzy
or dazed? How - how was your feeling internally in terms of where your head
was at?

I thought I was - I felt pain on my face. I thought I was fine. And sitting here
trying to recap all the events, I - I’m sort of - it - it’s becoming clear to me that
a lot of things that happened that I’m not aware of.

Right.

And I don’t know if it’s because it happened, and my brain didn’t process it.
Or if I didn’t see it. My attention was directed elsewhere.

Okay.
Um...

I mean, I’m not puttin’ words in your mouth, but you - sounds like you are
starting to see that there may be some gaps in your recollection since...

Yes.

...from after the time you got punched?

Yes.

Okay. Um, and then, uh - uh, what other training have you have had beside
CIT? Have you had verbal judo? Tactical communications? Anything like
that?

Yeah, I mean everything they teach in the POST academy. Um, uh...

Uh, in continuing CPT kind of stuff. Continuing professional training, I think.
I’ve taken a block of tactical communication.

Okay.
Um...

When you were an FTO in San Francisco were you ever in charge of teaching
that to others?

No.

No? Um, ever - ever had to teach anything as far as CIT related to one of your
trainees or anything like that?

Not - not - not in an official setting.

Right. But...

But yeah.

But critique after a call that kind of thing?

Right. Yeah.

Okay. So I’m going to ask you a big generalized question you don’t have to
jump at the answer. Take a minute. Based on everything we’ve talked about
over several minutes.

Mm-hm.

Anything about this that you didn’t have a chance to talk about that you
thought about now that you haven’t discussed? I didn’t ask the right question,
anything you want to correct or change or interject? Just take a minute to think
about that.

It’s not something that you can answer.

Mm-hm.

But it’s just what’s going on in my head. I just - I can’t figure out why this
happened. I don’t - I don’t know why he did that. I don’t know anything about

him. I’ve never seen him before. I’ve never had any prior contacts with him. I
don’t - I don’t know if he did it because - I just - I just - I just don’t know why

- why it went to the shitter so quickly.
Mm-hm.

And why - why it turned out like this.
Okay.

I - Ihave thought about how it could have turned out differently. Um, if - if
we had more units, we could have blocked off traffic and just kind of corralled
him. And even if he wanted to pace back and forth, we could try and establish
some kind of dialogue. You know? And actually, try to use CIT kind of...

Mm-hm.

...techniques. But he - he never. There was no communication between - at
least that I saw between myself and him. There was no - it - it would be easier
for me to understand if - if he said, when I said, “Hey man, let me talk to
you.” If he said, “Hey fuck you.”

Right.

It - it would be more. I - I could comprehend that a little bit more. Then I
know, okay. You have some problems - you have a problem with law
enforcement which may be warranted. You know, and I’ve had that happen
before and sometimes we - we work it out. I - I let people know, you know I
understand you may have had bad experiences with law enforcement. But I,
you know, give everybody a chance. I’m not - I - I don’t know. I’m just kind
of spit ballin’ here.

I understand.

But I - I don’t know why. There was - there was no communication. There
was no - there was nothing that he gave me that I could read off of to figure
out, you know, how - how can we do this without any force?

Okay.

You know? Um, maybe we could have, like I said, corralled him and created -
in San Francisco it’s time and distance. You know that’s - that’s the big thing
up there. Um, I kind of try to do that here where I just - I use the term over the
radio “paralleling him”. I wasn’t trying to force his hand or anything. I was
just circling around trying to get more - more resources there to - to make this
work. You know?

Mm-hm.

And I didn’t mention this earlier, but I don’t remember doing this. But from
the video I remember at one point prior to other units getting there I got out of
the car - I got out of the car multiple times. And I thought maybe this is the
chance where he’ll stop, and I can talk to him. And then he kept walking, so I
think I got out of the car two or three times. Got out and then he would just
walk about, and I would think, “Oh, shit. I have to get back in the car.” During
one of the times when he’s on the median, my biggest fear in that situation -
or one of my biggest fears is getting his by a car because I can’t see the car
comin’. Drivers are terrible, right? He’s gonna get hit by a car or I was gonna
hit by a car. So my biggest fear was getting’ hit by a car. And I remember
after I watched the video, I - I got out of the car and I said, “Hey, man. Let’s
go talk on the side walk.” You know?

Mm-hm.
“Talk to me. Tell me how much you hate cops. I’ll listen.” You know?
Mm-hm.

Just - just tell me somethin’. Don’t - don’t just walk away and, you know, I
don’t know. There - I think there would have been a different outcome.

Okay.

But, um...

Sir, do you have anything you’d like to clarify?
No [ have no questions.

Okay. Just give me two seconds, I’Il come back, and I’Il tell you what
happens from here and then you’re all done. All right?

All right.

Okay. All right so, um, uh, were you able to finish that?

Uh, not yet.

I'll leave you time to finish that. All right so what happens now is this is the
part you will not be used to from San Francisco County. So any investigation

we call an OICI, it’s an officer involved critical incident. That would include
an officer involved shooting, something like this. Uh, this would be in custody

death. Uh, we make it a point to complete the investigation from start to finish
in 8 weeks.

Okay.

Um, I know that’s not - that’s not the San Francisco policy...
That’s - that’s unheard of.

It’s extremely atypical - yeah.

So we - we will be done in eight weeks. And from that - I mean the final
report binders will go onto Mister Wagstaffe’s desk. Um, he will review
everything -and he will literally review everything, watch everything and, um,
then we’ll have a meeting where everybody, uh, basically contributes. Then
make a determination. An then at that time, typically what happens is he will
issue a letter to your agency.

Okay.

Now in that eight weeks, it is very possible that your agency will make the
decision independent to the DA’s office to let you return to work. Um, I
would advise you to return to work when you’re ready to go to work.

Okay.

Um, and - and from personal experience and having been on administrative
leave before from a critical incident. You go back to work when you’re ready.
We will have no bearing on that.

Okay.

Your agency will make that determination, and they may tell you - you are
free to go back. But again, I’ll tell you on a personal level, you go back when
you’re ready to go back. That may be before that eight weeks is up.

Okay.

So when final determination is made, you may have already been back on
patrol for, you know, X number of days. So, but it will be completed in 8
weeks. Um, if you wake up tomorrow - which it’s gonna happen. And you -
maybe you remember other things or things start to come back or more
details, um speak to him. It may not be - you may feel like it’s something you
need to pass on to us right away, you may talk to him and he’s going to tell
you it’s - it’s fine. Okay? But if there is something critical you remember that

you feel the need, we can certainly sit back down and do it. Okay?

All right.

But again, my advice is to go through him and see if it’s really that critical.
Okay?

All right.

Um, obviously if you wouldn’t mind completing that today.
Yeah - yeah.

You know, we just use that as part of the investigation.
Okay.

We're not going into your whole medical history.

Okay.

Um, and the other thing we’ll do it we will go to, um the Sheriff's Office. We
review the backgrounds and training...

Okay.

...of everyone that’s involved. You included. Um, we look at your
professional background. I don’t look at whether you like walks on the beach.
I just look at your background for the time you’re an officer. We look at, um -
um, accommodations, anything that’s in your file. We look at your training to
confirm that - that’s -that will all be a part of it.

Okay.

Um, but I don’t want you to think we go diving in. So in your file there will be
a letter signed by us saying that we looked at your file.

Okay.

That’s to make sure it’s all part of everything in the package that we give to

Okay.

That’s all - that’s all part of the report.

Okay.

Um, and then you’ ll have access to all that once it’s done, we typically make
two copies of it. Uh, it’s usually one or more 3-inch binders. Um, that includes
all the DVDs and everything and then the major report is a master summary
report. It’s usually about 40 or 50 pages. But it will all be made available to
you and your agency.

Okay.

Once it’s complete there is no part of our investigation that will be not to your
purview that you can’t look at it.

Okay.

And then you know once it’s done. We will then sometimes create a third one
where we redact a lot of stuff like personal information so that it’s open...

Public Record.
..public record. The press can look at it.
Okay.

And then, uh, you know chances are the press is going to get your name.
Chances are they’re going to publish it. I’m just telling you that up front.

Yes, and you need to articulate that to him, before that - that’s the case.
Okay.
Okay?

That’s, you know, death threats on - if you have social media. I mean,

like they know who you are and you know - and - and know where you live.
That kind of thing, and your family. Let us know immediately.

Okay.

SUPPLEMENT 13 - Interview of CSO Joey Gonzales

SUMMARY:

On October 5, 2018, at approximately 1:50 PM, I met with Community Service Office (CSO) Joseph
Gonzales and Sergeant Daniel Guiney San Mateo County Sheriff's Office. The purpose of the meeting
was to obtain a statement from CSO Gonzales about the incident in Millbrae on October 3"4, 2018. CSO
Gonzales had requested Sergeant Guiney (one of his supervisors) to be present with him in the
interview. I explained that the interview was recorded and that we only wanted to obtain a statement
from CSO Gonzales if it a non-compelled statement that was freely and voluntarily. CSO Gonzales
stated that he understood and confirmed that no one had told him he needed to provide a statement to us.

BACKGROUND:

Joseph Gonzales stated that he is employed by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office as a Community
Service Officer (CSO). He has been a CSO in the city of Millbrae for just over two years. He graduated
from a local high school in San Mateo County and has taken a few classes at the College of San Mateo.
He explained that his day-to-day duties include parking enforcement, traffic control, handling abandoned
vehicles and the intake of property. He sometimes assists with vehicle accident reports. His normal work
days are Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and his normal shift runs from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM.

Gonzales explained that he generally wears a uniform for his work and confirmed he was wearing his
uniform during this incident. He described the uniform he was wearing as a light blue San Mateo County
Sheriffs Office shirt, navy blue color cargo style pants, a black duty belt and black boots. He confirmed

that his uniform shirt has Sheriff's Office shoulder patches, and a “Community Service Officer” badge
(#13) and name tag on his chest.

Gonzales reported that his duty-belt was equipped with the following items: keys, police radio, latex
glove holder, OC spray (pepper spray), a tourniquet, Narcan and a digital recorder. When questioned
more specifically, Gonzales confirmed that he did not carry a firearm, Taser, baton, asp, or handcuffs.
(Gonzales later told me after the interview that he carries his digital recorder to in case he needs to
obtain a statement in an accident investigation but confirmed he never activated his recorder during this
incident.) Gonzales told me that he received no specific training or certifications related to arrest control
tactics or his carrying of OC spray. He confirmed that he has received in-house training that is directly
related to his daily duties.

Gonzales drives an assigned vehicle when he works. On this particular day he was driving Vehicle #15
which is a Ford F150 pick-up truck. The truck is equipped with emergency lights to assist with traffic
control.

STATEMENT OF INCIDENT:

Gonzales confirmed that he began his shift at 7:00 AM. He started his shift by handling some parking
complaints and a vehicle that needed to be towed. He confirmed that there was nothing that had
happened that was out of the ordinary or emotionally charged.

SUPPLEMENT 13 - Interview of CSO Joey Gonzales

Gonzales first became aware of the incident as he was finishing his “covering” duties for the records
technician. He described hearing an initial radio call from Deputy Wang requesting another officer and
then hearing the situation has changed to a “Code-3” call for assistance. Gonzales explained that since
the call originated as a “person running through traffic on El Camino” he felt that he might be needed to
block traffic and/or re-route traffic with his assigned vehicle. He left the station in his vehicle and
traveled, what he estimates to be four to five blocks, to the scene. He traveled north on El] Camino Real
and stopped his vehicle in the northbound lanes near the scene. From his stopped position, he could see
the team of deputies in the #1 and #2 southbound lanes of El Camino Real. He identified the team of
deputies as Bryan Watt, Alyssa Lorenzatti, Josh Wang and Sergeant Dave Weidner.

Gonzales activated his emergency lights and repositioned his vehicle at an angle to try and block the
northbound left turn lane and the northbound #1 and #2 lanes of El Camino Real.

Gonzales described still being seated in his vehicle and seeing the group of deputies as it moved towards
his location in pursuit of the man. He remembered that the deputies were yelling at the man to stop as
they proceeded after him over the center median. He could not remember exactly what was being yelled,
but it was clear they were trying to get the man to stop. Gonzales described the man as being a large
black man, with scuff on his face, and wearing a blue shirt. He estimated the man was over 6’ tall and
between 240 to 250 lbs.

Gonzales looked to his right side briefly (to see if there were any vehicles on the right side of his
vehicle) and when he looked back he saw that the group had tripped or fallen to the ground near the left
rear of his vehicle. He was unsure how they ended up on the ground but the entire team was on the
ground struggling with the man. Gonzales decided the group might need his help to control the man so
he exited the truck and joined the group. Gonzales grabbed the man’s right arm and hand. In an effort to
keep the man from hitting the officers he held the arm as securely to his own chest as he could. (NOTE:
Gonzales demonstrated this in the interview by grabbing his own hands together and pushing them up
against his chest.) He could not remember the specifics of what was being said at this moment but he
remembered that deputies were repeatedly telling the man to stop resisting and to put his hands behind
his back.

Gonzales was unsure if someone on the team deployed pepper spray (OC spray) but several of the
involved deputies backed away from the man while still trying to get him under control. Gonzales saw
that some of the deputies were suffering from pepper spray but he didn’t see anyone deploy it and he did
not get the spray on him in the incident. Gonzales confirmed that he did not deploy his own spray in this
incident.

Deputy Watt, who suffered from exposure to the pepper spray, handed Gonzales an extra pair of
handcuffs. Gonzales was intending to hand off the extra handcuffs and help put them on the struggling

man but the other officers were successful in getting the man handcuffed without his assistance.
Gonzales is not sure who actually handcuffed the man.

Gonzales explained that once the man was handcuffed, they sat him up on his rear end. Someone asked
for water to rinse the pepper spray from their eyes. Gonzales didn’t have any water in his truck, so he
walked over to a nearby dentist office and they supplied him with bottled water.

Gonzales clarified that when he left the immediate area of the scene, to search for water, the man was
sitting upright but “out of it.” He elaborated that the man was conscious, awake, breathing and looking
around. He described in more detail that the man was seated, with his legs out in front of him, while
leaning back against the legs of two deputies who were standing directly behind the man. He confirmed
the two deputies were using their legs to provide the man with something to lean against but he could
not remember exactly which two deputies were standing behind the man.

Gonzales estimated that he returned to the immediate scene about one minute later with the water.
Gonzales heard someone request medics, which had been staged nearby, and he confirmed the man was
still seated upright when he returned. Gonzales qualified that while he saw the man was seated upright
upon his return, he did not notice if the man was still conscious.

Medics were called in to help. Gonzales thought that the medics has been called into the scene because
of the pepper spray exposure and because one of the deputies had suffered a significant cut on his face.

Gonzales then approached Sergeant Weidner and asked him what else needed to be done. Sergeant
Weidner asked him to stop traffic and redirect the passing vehicles with better traffic control. He
explained that once traffic control was properly established he stepped back out of the way and acted as
a “rover” by checking in with various deputies to see if they needed anything.

I asked Gonzales when he first realized there was “something wrong” with the man. He told me that he
never really realized there was anything wrong. He explained that when anyone is tased the medics are
called to check them out, so he didn’t think there was anything significant about the medics being
involved.

When asked about the man being transported in an ambulance, Gonzales acknowledged that the fire
department personnel were “working” on the man (administering chest compression) as he was being
transported to the ambulance. Gonzales added that he thought the man was alright once he had been
placed on the ambulance.

Gonzales stated that once the patients (Decedent Chinedu Okobi and Deputy Josh Wang) were
transported the remaining personnel cleared the area, put up crime scene tape and established a perimeter
with a scene log.

SUPPLEMENT 13 - Interview of CSO Joey Gonzales

When asked, Gonzales confirmed he did not see the man get tased but he did notice a taser prong and
taser wires when he was restraining the man’s hand and arm. He thought the prong might have been in
the man’s right arm or in the right side of his chest.

When asked why he exited his truck and got involved in this incident Gonzales stated, “It was a just a
reaction. I saw that the team was struggling, um, I saw that they were not able to apprehend him and I
saw that his right hand was flailing.” He confirmed that he feared the team would not be able to establish
control over the man. He described the man flailing his right arm and hand at Deputy Wang who was
grabbing him around the body. The blows delivered by the man to Deputy Wang were both open hand
and closed hand. He explained that the man was “fighting” with five people and the five people were not
able to stop him. Gonzales said that people were out on the street watching and traffic was still moving;
he didn’t know what might happen if the man got up and continued down the street.

Gonzales confirmed that the only physical involvement he had with the man was when he restrained the
man’s hand and arm before he was handcuffed. Gonzales also confirmed that he didn’t deliver any
blows or strikes, didn’t use pepper spray, didn’t use a taser (even someone else’s taser) against the man.
Gonzales told me that he is trained as a second degree black-belt martial arts instructor. When asked
specifically, he confirmed that he did not apply any martial arts techniques on the man.

Gonzales estimated that six to seven minutes elapsed from the time that he arrived on the scene to the
time that the man was handcuffed.

Gonzales reported that he suffered no injuries in the incident. He remarked that he did get some of the
man’s blood on his shoulder, pants and forearm. He was unsure if the man’s chest was bleeding but he
thinks came into contact with the blood when he restrained the man’s arm up against his chest.

OVERHEAD PHOTO:

Gonzales was shown an overhead photo of the scene. They photo had been taken with a camera mounted
on a drone and was taken after the decedent had been transported and a crime scene had been
established. He marked the overhead photo in the described manner:

Circled the location of his assigned vehicle (VEH #15)

in the location where he first saw the group of officers struggling with the man

in the location where he saw the group of offices pursuing the man in the roadway

in the location where the man and the officers went to the ground and where he became involved
by temporarily restraining the man’s right arm

When he had completed marking the photo he signed the bottom left edge.

SUPPLEMENT 14 - Initial Statements Obtained by 18-1003-02
SMCO SO Deputies/ W's Barboza and Neil

Investigation:
At the scene of the incident on October 3, 2018, San Mateo County Sheriff's Office personnel turned

over three pages of handwritten notes on yellow paper to San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office
Inspectors who had arrived on scene to investigate the incident. The handwritten notes appeared to be
initial statements taken by San Mateo County Sheriff's Deputies from Witnesses Dennis Barboza and
Paul Neily.

Both Dennis Barboza and Paul Neily were re-interviewed in detail. Dennis Barboza was interviewed by
Menlo Park Police Detective Josh Russell (Officer Involved Critical Incident Team Member) on October
3, 2018 and Paul Neily was interviewed by District Attorney Inspector Eric Suzuki on October 5, 2018.

San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Sergeant Irfan Zaidi confirmed that Deputy John Demartini obtained
some initial statements at the scene and Dennis Barboza and Paul Neily were two of those witnesses.
Due to the fact that Deputy Demartini was one of the Deputies who was involved in the critical incident,
no supplemental report was generated by him to memorialize the statements. Sergeant Zaidi also
confirmed that Deputy Demartini did not record either of the interviews he conducted with Dennis
Barboza and Paul Neily.

Seeing that both witness have been re-interviewed in detail by members of the San Mateo County
District Attorney’s Office and/or by members of the Officer Involved Critical Incident Team, I have
attached copies of the handwritten notes to this supplemental report. (The pdf copy of the handwritten
notes are 6 pages in length, simply to show that the back side of each page was blank). (Please refer to

SUPPLEMENT 16 - Uniform & Equipment Collections

Investigation:
On 10/3/2018, at approximately 1415 hours, I responded to the intersection of El Camino Real and

Millwood in the city of Millbrae to assist with an officer involved critical incident involving deputies
from the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office. Upon my arrival, I was requested to respond to the Westin
San Francisco Airport Hotel located at a 1 Old Bayshore Hwy in Millbrae for the purpose of collecting
the uniforms and equipment of the involved Sheriff's Office personnel.

Upon my arrival at the hotel, I made contact with Sheriffs Deputy and DSA (Deputy Sheriff's
Association) President DJ Wozniak. Wozniak told me that the involved deputies were sequestered in
individual rooms and each was accompanied by a peer support representative. He also stated that
photographs of the deputies and sergeant while in full uniform were already completed by a Sheriff’s
Office detective. I subsequently responded to each of the rooms and collected uniforms from the
following persons:

Deputy Bryan Watt
Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti
Deputy John DeMartini
Deputy Joshua Wang
Sergeant David Weidner

I collected the full uniform and duty belts from all of the above listed personnel with the exception of
Deputy Wang. Deputy Wang told me that his shirt, ballistic vest, and duty belt with equipment was
previously taken for the purpose of preserving its condition by Sheriff’s Office Sergeant Szerenyi.

I placed the each of the complete uniforms into separate large paper bags and I transported the bags to
the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office to secure them. I later photographed each of the
uniforms and I provided the photographs to Inspector Draper for inclusion with the case file.

SUPPLEMENT 17 - Interview of Witness Emil Cafferata

Investigation:

Statement of Witness Emil Cafferata:

Witness Emil Cafferata had contacted the Millbrae Substation for the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office
on or around October 16, 2018. San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Dan Guiney contacted me
and asked that a member of the San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office contact Cafferata, as he
indicated that he may have information regarding the Millbrae incident from October 3, 2018. District
Attorney Inspector Eric Suzuki attempted to contact Cafferata on October 17 and 18*, but he was
unable to leave a message on Mr. Cafferata’s cell phone. Inspector Suzuki was off duty on Friday
October 19, 2018 and I was alerted that Mr. Cafferata wished to speak with someone regarding the
incident, so I called and left a voicemail message on his cell phone. It should be noted that the
voicemail greeting was a female with a name of Renee and the phone was able to accept a voicemail
message on October 19**, which had been unsuccessful for Inspector Suzuki on October 17" and 18%.

On October 19, 2018 at approximately 1545 hours, Emil Cafferata called my office phone and provided
a statement. I recorded the phone call via a digital recorder connected to my office phone. The
following is a summary of my conversation with Emil Cafferata:

Emil Cafferata stated that he previously “encountered the black guy who was stunned and died.”
Cafferata said that he left a couple of messages with the Sheriff's Office and also with the San Jose
Mercury News. I asked Cafferata to tell me what information he had regarding the incident.

Cafferata said that he and his wife returned from Hawaii approximately three or so weeks ago and they
were “doing their usual walk on Broadway Street” in downtown Millbrae. Cafferata identified a jewelry
store on Broadway that he first believed to Millbrae Jewelers, but then later clarified that it was Numis
International, one block south. Cafferata said that he and his wife were walking northbound on
Broadway when he saw “a black guy coming on the other side of the street.” Cafferata stated that what
caught his eye was that the subject began walking down the middle of the street, towards him and his
wife. Cafferata said that the subject had a little boy with him (ultimately estimated to be approximately
five years old) and the subject wasn’t holding the boy’s hand. Cafferata said that the young child “could
barely keep up” with the subject.

Cafferata stated that the subject “was making like a beehive towards me” and Cafferata was concerned
for the young child whom he believed was with the subject, specifically fearing that the child may get hit
by a car. Cafferata said that the subject began yelling in front of him and his wife, “White people keep
calling the police on us black folk” and Cafferata said that “black folk struck me as, maybe southern,
you don’t hear that around here too often and he said it several times as he passed us.” Cafferata stated
that the subject didn’t bump into them, but then he added, “I looked him in the eye and he wasn’t
looking at me, he was looking into space kind of.” Cafferata said that as he got about twenty feet behind
them, he (Cafferata) responded by saying, “Yeah, but I’ve never called the police on anybody.”

SUPPLEMENT 17 - Interview of Witness Emil Cafferata

Cafferata stated that the subject turned around and faced him and said, “That don’t matter” and he said
that twice. Cafferata said that the subject wasn’t making eye contact with him and he felt that he was
“Jooking out into space.”

Cafferata stated that the subject then crossed the street back over to the opposite side of the street, so
Cafferata had the impression that the subject had crossed the street simply to make the statement to him
(Cafferata). Cafferata said that the subject crossed in the middle of the street and he thought that he
might have been headed back to BART, which is in close proximity to downtown Millbrae. Cafferata
stated that the subject and the boy were both well dressed and he said the subject was clean cut and
didn’t look like “a street person.” Cafferata thought about calling the police at that time, but he formed
the opinion that the subject had not really done anything wrong, so he decided not to.

Cafferata stated that several days later, he heard about an incident in Millbrae and he read an article in
the Mercury News and believed the subject mentioned in the article may have been the one he had
encountered in Downtown Millbrae. Cafferata said that he called the Mercury News to tell them that he
may have seen the person, but never heard back from the Mercury News. Cafferata said that he then left
a message on the anonymous tip line at the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office, Redwood City Branch.
Cafferata stated that he saw media coverage of the incident in Millbrae from October 3, 2018 and as
soon as he saw photos of the decedent, he knew that was the same person he had encountered in
Downtown Millbrae previously. Cafferata said that he contacted a Sergeant with the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office, Millbrae Division (Sergeant Dan Guiney) and provided him with that information and
wanted to pass it along to investigators. Cafferata stated that he believed that the jewelry shop in
downtown Millbrae may have cameras, but he wasn’t sure if they retained footage from three weeks ago.

I asked some clarifying questions of Cafferata. Cafferata stated that he and his wife returned from
Hawaii on “a Sunday”, so the event he mentioned occurred on “Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday.” Cafferata estimated the date to be approximately the 20 or 21% of September. Cafferata
estimated the time of the encounter to be in between 2:00 and 3:30 pm, stating that is the typical time
that he and his wife normally walk.

I clarified the location with Cafferata as being in front of Numis International, Inc. which was located at
301 Broadway in Millbrae, at the intersection of La Cruz Avenue. Cafferata stated that he and his wife
typically start a block south of that location and walk north from there. Cafferata said that they were on
the west side of the street, walking north and the subject was walking south. Cafferata explained that as
the subject crossed the street from the opposite side, he (the subject) was not holding the hand of the
little boy that Cafferata believed was with him. Cafferata said, “The little boy could barely keep up with
this guy.” Cafferata stated, “I could tell he wasn’t drunk, he was walking quickly in a straight line and in
a strong fashion, not leisurely.”

Cafferata stated that the little boy was trying to hold the subject’s hand and he said that the little boy was

approximately two feet away from the subject when he was yelling at the Cafferatas and then the little
boy “followed him the whole rest of the way.”

Cafferata said that the subject came through parked cars and their paths intersected. Cafferata stated that
the subject didn’t look at him, but he began yelling, “White folk, white people are calling the cops on the
black folks.” Cafferata said, “That’s not right.” Cafferata stated that the subject walked approximately
ten feet south of where they were and then he yelled the same thing again. Cafferata said that the subject
walked another five or six feet south and there were other people around that were looking at what was
happening. Cafferata stated that he responded to the individual, “Yeah, but I’ve never called the police
on anybody.” Cafferata said that the subject stopped, turned around towards him and said, “But that
don’t count.” Cafferata stated that even though the subject was looking in his direction, the subject
wasn’t looking at him face to face, rather he was looking in his direction, but still off into space.
Cafferata said that the subject turned back around again and walked off in the opposite direction, still
south, but diagonally across the street to the side that he had started on.

Cafferata stated that he had seen media coverage of the event from the October 3" incident and he and
his wife were certain that the person they had seen on the news footage was the person he encountered
on September 20% or 21%. I asked Cafferata to put aside the fact that he had seen media reports and had
identified the subject as being the decedent from the October 3*4 incident. I asked Cafferata to provide
me with a description of the subject that he encountered.

Cafferata stated that he “had already heard” the subject’s physical description from the news, but he
agreed that the subject was approximately 6’3” and he was heavy. Cafferata said that the news reports
identified the subject as “3 and a quarter” (325 pounds) and he stated that he believed that by saying that
the subject was twice his weight. Cafferata said that the subject wasn’t muscular, but he was “big” and
he had “a little bit of a belly on him and he was round.” Cafferata stated that the subject was dressed
casually, he had short hair and he was “medium colored black, he wasn’t real dark or real light.”
Cafferata said that when the subject walked by him, he had to be at least three hundred pounds and he
described him as “a big guy.”

Cafferata said, “When I walked away, I was thinking boy, something’s wrong with him, he wouldn’t
even look, didn’t even look at me.” Cafferata stated, “This guy looked a little goofy, not normal at all.”
Cafferata said that he felt the subject “just wanted to get something off of his chest” when he made the
remarks to or near Emil Cafferata and his wife. Cafferata said, “Why me, I don’t know, but it was loud
enough that people all, several stores up were turning and looking back at us” and Cafferata described
the conversation as “loud.”

Supplemental Report to Case #18-1003-02:

On October 17, 2018 at approximately 1330 hours, I met with San Mateo County Sheriff's Office
Training Sergeant Bob Pronske at the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office/ Coyote Point Training
Facility. Sergeant Pronske is the Lead Firearm and Taser Instructor for the San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office. I personally transported the (5) tasers that had been issued to the Involved Sheriff's Deputies in
the Millbrae incident from October 3, 2018 to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office/ Coyote Point
Training Facility. I was personally present the entire time while Sergeant Pronske conducted the taser
downloads and Sergeant Pronske wore gloves the entire time, at my request. I retained custody of the
tasers, following the downloads.

Sergeant Bob Pronske connected each of the following tasers and downloaded them utilizing Axon’s
software. Sergeant Pronkse provided me with pdf copies of each taser download report.

(It should be noted that each taser download report will show a “Sync” event on October 17, 2018,
which is when the individual taser was plugged in and downloaded by Sergeant Pronske).

The following are summaries of each download:

Deputy Bryan Watt’s assigned taser:
Deputy Watt’s X26 Taser (Serial #X00-380563)
(SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02, Evidence Item #23)

Deputy Watt’s Taser X26 was last powered on October 1, 2018 at 05:24:51 hours for 5 seconds. That
activation would be consistent with Deputy Watt conducting a 5 second “spark test” to ensure his
assigned taser was functioning correctly.

Deputy Watt’s Taser X26 did not appear to have been deployed in the October 3, 2018 incident in
Millbrae.

(Please refer to the attached 37 page pdf entitled Deputy Watt’s Taser Download for specific details).

Deputy John Demartini’s assigned taser:
Deputy Demartini’s X26 Taser (Serial #X00-564295)
(SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02, Evidence Item #24)

Deputy Demartini’s Taser X26 was last powered on September 27, 2018 at 05:56:20 hours for 5
seconds. That activation would be consistent with Deputy Demartini conducting a 5 second “spark test”
to ensure his assigned taser was functioning correctly.

Deputy Demartini’s Taser X26 did not appear to have been deployed in the October 3, 2018 incident in
Millbrae.

(Please refer to the attached 4 page pdf entitled Deputy Demartini’s Taser Download for specific

(SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02, Evidence Item #7)

Sergeant Weidner’s Taser X26P was “Armed” on October 3, 2018 at 13:17:17 hours and then placed
back on “Safe” on October 3, 2017 at 13:17:30. Sergeant Weidner’s Taser X26P did not appear to have
been deployed in the October 3, 2018 incident in Millbrae, other than being taken out of the holster,
taken off of “Safe” or “Armed” and then placed back on “Safe” approximately 13 seconds later. That
information is corroborated by video at the scene showing Sergeant Weidner with his Taser X26P in his
hand and then re-holstering it.

(Please refer to the attached 41 page pdf entitled Sergeant Weidner’s Taser Download for specific
details).

Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti’s assigned taser:
Deputy Lorenzatti’s X26P Taser (Serial #X13004AD5)
(SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02, Evidence Item #6)

Deputy Lorenzatti’s Taser X26P had the following activity on October 3, 2018:
13:32:00 Armed
13:32:05 Safe
13:32:07 Armed
13:32:07 Safe

13:33:46 Safe
13:33:48 Armed
13:33:48 Safe
13:33:51 Armed
13:33:51 Safe

Deputy Lorenzatti’s Taser X26P did not appear to have been deployed in the October 3, 2018 incident in
Millbrae, other than being taken out of the holster, taken off of “Safe” or “Armed” and then placed back
on “Safe”, armed and then placed back on safe a total of six separate times in between 13:32:00 and
13:33:51 (1 minute and 51 seconds). That information is corroborated by video at the scene showing
Deputy Lorenzatti with her Taser X26P in her hand, but not deploying it.

(Please refer to the attached 17 page pdf entitled Deputy Wang’s Taser Download for specific details).

In my discussions with Sergeant Pronske, he stated that the 13:08:17 “Armed” activation indicated that
Deputy Wang un-holstered his taser and took the safety off, effectively arming it for deployment. The
subsequent “Trigger” 4 and 5 second log entries indicated that Deputy Wang pulled the trigger and
deployed his Taser X26P. Sergeant Pronske stated that the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office trains
their staff members to pull the trigger on their assigned taser and then release the trigger. That pull and
telease action to the trigger places the taser in a mode where it automatically delivers a maximum 5
second shock cycle, unless manually shut down, prior to the elapsed 5 seconds. A user could place the
taser in “Safe” mode, which will automatically stop delivering any type of shock. Sergeant Pronske
stated that the last “Trigger” cycle logged on Deputy Wang’s taser (13:09:52) only had a duration of 4
seconds and the entry at 13:09:56 showed “Safe”, which indicated that Deputy Wang manually stopped
the automatic 5 second cycle after 4 seconds by placing the safety mechanism on.

Sergeant Pronske informed me that Taser X26 and X26P’s could be deployed and activated for longer
than 5 seconds by pulling and holding the trigger. Sergeant Pronske stated that holding the trigger down
would signal the taser to continue a shock cycle longer than 5 seconds and that cycle could last until the
battery in the taser ran out. Sergeant Pronske believed that when a trigger is pressed and held on the
tasers, a deployment over 5 seconds would continue a shock cycle, but would decrease the power of the
shock.

Sergeant Pronske stated that the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office trains staff members to pull and
release the triggers on the taser, deploying a maximum 5 second cycle. Once a 5 second cycle has
concluded, Sergeant Pronske stated that San Mateo County Sheriff's Office members are trained to re-
assess the situation and only deploy another 5 second cycle (trigger pull and release), if necessary.
Sergeant Pronske stated that was what he saw when reviewing the event log for Deputy Wang’s Taser
X26P. Deputy Wang appears to have deployed his Taser X26P for a total of (6) 5 second cycles and (1)
4 second cycle, indicating that Deputy Wang pulled the trigger and released and then manually placed
the taser into safe mode on the last deployment cycle at the 4 second mark. Nothing in the event log
indicted to Sergeant Pronske that Deputy Wang pulled and held the trigger, which would have deployed
a shock cycle longer than 5 seconds.

I was familiar with discrepancies in times on taser event logs from previous investigations, but I asked
Sergeant Pronske about the differences in “Armed, Safe and Trigger” event times for Deputy Wang’s,
Deputy Lorenzatti’s and Sergeant’s Weidner’s tasers. Specifically, Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P showed
an initial “Armed” time stamp of 13:08:17, Deputy Lorenzatti’s Taser X26P showed an initial “Armed”
time stamp of 13:32:00, and Sergeant Weidner’s Taser X26P showed an initial “Armed” time stamp of
13:17:17. Sergeant Pronske stated that the duration times should all be accurate, but the actual event
times (hours, minutes and seconds) on the tasers can deviate and are only completely accurate when

“Synched” with the Axon/ Taser software.

That information was consistent with what Inspector Kevin Raffaelli was told by Axon Corporation
Technical Services Division on January 25, 2018, when he contacted them for San Mateo County
District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigations Case #18-0117-02. Inspector Raffaelli was told by
Axon (the manufacturer of Taser X26 and Taser X26P’s) the following:

The ‘Time Sync’ occurs after the download takes place, so the data (time) which is listed for the Taser
activation is based on the time of the internal clock on the Taser. Once the download is complete, the
‘Time sync’ (adjusted time) would be updated in the Taser clock.

The last time Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P was plugged in for a “Time Sync” was on October 2, 2017 at
19:04:47 hours.

The last time Deputy Lorenzatti’s Taser X26P was plugged in for a “Time Sync” was on July 18, 2016 at
13:20:10 hours. There were two other “Configuration” events in Deputy Lorenzatti’s Taser X26P event
log that may have updated the internal clock in between July 18, 2016 and October 3, 2018, but even the
most recent one was October 27, 2017 at 17:07:31 hours.

The last time Sergeant Weidner’s Taser X26P was plugged in for a “Time Sync” was May 9, 2016 at
14:54:40 hours. Like Deputy Lorenzatti’s Taser X26P, there were other “Configuration” events in
Sergeant Weidner’s Taser X26P event log that may have updated the internal clock in between May 9,
2016 and October 3, 2018, but even the most recent one was March 6, 2017 at 09:46:18.

Sergeant Pronske identified the two types of tasers carried by the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office
personnel as the Axon Taser X26 and Axon Taser X26P. Sergeant Pronske stated that the X26P was a
newer version of the X26. Sergeant Pronske stated that Axon has introduced a newer version of the
taser, the Taser 7, but that product is very new to the market and the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office
has not purchased any Taser 7’s at this time. Sergeant Pronske confirmed that Deputies Watt and
Demartini were issued and were carrying the Taser X26 and Deputies Wang, Lorenzatti and Sergeant
Weidner had been issued and were carrying the newer X26P versions. Sergeant Pronske also stated that
Sergeant David Weidner is a taser instructor for the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office.

San Mateo County Sheriffs Office Conducted Energy Device (Taser) Policy:

Sergeant Pronske provided me with San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Policy #304, entitled Conducted
Energy Device (Taser). Sergeant Pronske stated that Policy #304 is the most current taser policy that
was in effect on October 3, 2108.

Section 7 on page 2 of the policy specifically states:

The TASER shall be activated against a suspect for no more than five seconds whereupon an evaluation
will be made to determine if further use is required. Deputy / Sergeants should consider whether a full

five second cycle is necessary to gain compliance. During this evaluation clear orders should be given
to the subject. If additional cycles are required, the number and duration of those cycles shall be the
minimum number of activations necessary to take the person into custody.

The listed policy was consistent with the training that Sergeant Pronske referred to, specifically
deploying the taser for a maximum of 5 seconds (trigger pull and release) and then re-assessing after the
completion of a 5 second cycle.

(Please refer to attached San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Policy #304, entitled Conducted Energy
Device (Taser).

San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Conducted Energy Device (Taser) Training:

Sergeant Pronske stated that all San Mateo County Sheriff's Office employees who are eligible to carry
tasers (Deputies, Sergeants, Lieutenants, Captains and other Command Staff Members) are required to
attend a 6 hour minimum training course initially, prior to being issued a taser. Sergeant Pronske said
that the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office also offers a 4 hour training refresher course on the taser that
is offered as needed. Sergeant Pronske provided me with a 207 slide Powerpoint presentation which
was marked as Version 20- Effective January 1, 2016. Sergeant Pronske stated that the 207 slide
Powerpoint presentation was the most current training presentation that was being utilized in all San
Mateo County Sheriff's Office training sessions.

(Please refer to attached training Powerpoint presentation, entitled X26P User Course V20).

On October 19, 2018 at approximately 1330 hours, I personally booked Deputy Joshua Wang’s assigned
Taser X26P (Serial #X13004A6P and SMCO DA’s Office Bureau Case #18-1003-02, Evidence Item #
5) into the Property and Evidence area of the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office.

On October 22, 2018 at approximately 1400 hours, I turned over the other four tasers to San Mateo
County Sheriff’s Office Professional Standards Sergeant, Jon Sebring. The four tasers released were:
Deputy Watt’s X26 Taser (Serial #X00-380563)

SUPPLEMENT 20 - Civilian Video - Dennis Barboza

On 10-26-18, I spoke to Dennis Barboza regarding the interior video for his store located at 1486 El

Camino Real in Millbrae to determine if the camera had captured anything relevant to this investigation.

He in turn emailed me a link to the video captured at the time of the incident. I then used that link to

download and retain it as evidence in this case.

The video itself does not seem to capture relevant details of the event, neither visually nor audibly. The

exterior view is distorted by sunlight and related glare from the windows.

The video will still be retained as evidence.

SUPPLEMENT 21 - WatchGuard MAV System Technical Information

Investigation:
On October 17, 2018, I contacted San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Technology Unit Supervisor,

Steven Yu. Steven Yu identified the Mobile Audio Video (MAV) system that the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office utilizes in the Millbrae patrol vehicles as WatchGuard MAV. Steven Yu provided a list
of “triggers” that start or flag a recording for upload to the Digital Video Recorder (DVR). The list of
triggers Steven Yu provided are listed below:

The activation of the patrol vehicle light bar.
. The activation of the WatchGuard Video system’s wireless microphone.
. A sudden crash of the patrol vehicle.

The patrol vehicle’s speed over 83 mph.

The manual activation by the officer or deputy.

Steven Yu told me that the WatchGuard MAV system is constantly recording and when one of the above
“triggers” occur, the WatchGuard MAV system is configured to mark the recording 30 seconds prior to
the trigger. The 30 seconds that is marked (pre-trigger) is then recorded onto the DVR, along with the
event itself. Steven Yu stated that the pre-trigger time (30 seconds) does not include audio.

Steve Yu confirmed that all of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office (Millbrae) patrol vehicles had the
flagged event, along with the 30 second pre-incident segment (when applicable) downloaded as part of
the on-going investigation. I confirmed with Steve Yu that the WatchGuard MAV systems are “always”
recording and Steven Yu confirmed that was correct. With that information, I asked Steven Yu if it
would be possible to obtain recorded footage from Vehicle MB10 (Deputy Joshua Wang’s assigned
vehicle) on October 3, 2018 that occurred prior to the actual trigger and 30 second pre-trigger segment.
Steven Yu personally responded to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Millbrae Substation on
October 17, 2018. Steven Yu removed the DVR from Vehicle MB10 to see if he could recover any
additional events or recordings from the October 3, 2018 incident. Steven Yu re-contacted me later on
October 17 to inform me that events prior to October 13, 2108 on the DVR inside MB10 had been
recorded or written over.

SUPPLEMENT 22 - Tri Counties Bank ATM Video SAC

Investigation:
On October 4, 2018, DA Inspector Greg Giguiere received a total of 11 digital video files from Tri

Counties Bank Business Continuity and Security Officer, Richard Ellena. The 11 digital video files
contained footage from the ATM machine in front of the Tri Counties Bank located at 1551 El Camino
Real in Millbrae, CA from October 3, 2018. The ATM camera was pointed directly in front of the bank
and should have been in position to capture footage from the event on October 3, 2018 that our office is
investigating.

I have provided a summary of the digital video files below. It should be noted that the quality and
clarity of the videos are poor.

Video #1 labeled:

The date and time shown at the beginning of the video was:

10-03-2018 at 13:00:32

The video was approximately 9 seconds in length total

Due to the poor quality of the video, I did not observe anything of evidentiary value on the 9 second
video.

Video #2 labeled:

Embedded Net DVR_10.3.43.20_11_20181003130124 _20181003130135_ 15386713227...

The date and time shown at the beginning of the video was:

10-03-2018 at 13:01:20

The video was approximately 6 seconds in length total

A San Mateo County Sheriff's Office vehicle with overhead lights on can be seen in the middle of the
intersection. The vehicle is believed to be MB #10, Deputy Joshua Wang’s patrol vehicle. A person,
believed to be Decedent Chinedu Okobi can be seen moving quickly northbound across the street from
the ATM camera, while the SMCO SO patrol vehicle moves slowly behind the person.

Video #3 labeled:

Embedded Net DVR_10.3.43.20_11_20181003130220_20181003130412_ 15386713242...

The date and time shown at the beginning of the video was:

10-03-2018 at 13:02:16

The video was approximately 1 minute, 50 seconds in length total

At approximately 13:02:23, a white male adult walks up to the ATM and begins using the ATM
machine. In addition to the overall poor quality of the video, the male’s body covers a good portion of
the screen.

At 13:02:34, a San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office vehicle with overhead lights on arrives and pulls up in
front of the bank on the wrong side of the street. That vehicle was identified as Deputy Lorenzatti’s
patrol vehicle.

SUPPLEMENT 22 - Tri Counties Bank ATM Video SAC

@ SAN MATEO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

At 13:02:43, Deputy Lorenzatti can be seen moving into view of the camera northbound on the sidewalk
area, in front of the bank.

At 13:02:45, a second San Mateo County Sheriff's Office vehicle with overhead lights on arrives and
pulls up in front of the bank, further north on the wrong side of the street. That vehicle was identified as
Deputy Demartini’s patrol vehicle.

At 13:02:47, Deputy Lorenzatti can be seen pointing in the direction of where Decedent Chinedu Okobi
was walking (based upon my review of other available videos).

At 13:02:54, Deputy Demartini can be seen running towards Decedent Chinedu Okobi, who has just
entered into the far left side view of the ATM camera.

At 13:02:54, Deputy Demartini can be seen attempting to grab Decedent Chinedu Okobi as Okobi raises
his hands. Deputy Lorenzatti appears to be attempting to also grab Okobi.

At 13:02:57, the customer at the ATM machine looks at what is occurring behind him and at the same
time, he blocks a large portion of what would have been caught on the camera.

At 13:02:57, Deputy Demartini appears to be trying to hold onto Decedent Chinedu Okobi’s sweater,
while Deputy Lorenzatti is behind Okobi, Deputy Wang is running towards Okobi and the other two
deputies from the left side of the camera angle.

At 13:03:01, the three deputies and Decedent Chinedu Okobi are to the far right of the screen and barely
visible to the ATM camera.

At 13:03:07, Decedent Chinedu Okobi has pulled away from the deputies and the customer at the ATM
machine has backed up against the ATM machine, blocking almost the entire screen.

Most of what occurs in between 13:03:07 and 13:03:31 can hardly be seen due to the customer at the
ATM machine blocking the camera view (as he continues his ATM transaction, despite the struggle that
is going on behind him).

At 13:04:01, the customer at the ATM machine finishes his transaction and leaves the ATM machine.

At that time, the San Mateo County Sheriff's Deputies and Decedent Chinedu Okobi are to the far right
of the screen. Due to the poor video quality, it is extremely difficult to see much of what is occurring.
Due to the existence of better quality videos, I have not documented any of the actions that cannot be
seen clearly in the ATM videos.

SUPPLEMENT 23 - Days Inn/ Brenda Landeros and 18-1003-02
Mayra Martinez Video Analysis

Investigation:
Menlo Park Police Detectives Jeremy Ordone and Josh Russell responded to the scene of the Millbrae

Officer Involved Critical Incident on October 3, 2018 as part of the San Mateo County Officer Involved
Critical Incident Team. Detectives Ordone and Russell documented the interviews they conducted in
Menlo Park Police Department Report #18-2659 (attached to the main investigative report). Detectives
Ordone and Russell had the following surveillance and/or cell phone videos turned over to them as part
of their witness interviews:

Witness Brenda Landeros: Cell phone video (1 video file entitled video 000000)

Days Inn: Garage surveillance video entitled 20181003125953_20181003130241 2_
20181011140707

Witness Mayra Martinez: Cell phone video (3 video files entitled IMG_2089, IMG_ 2090 and
IMG 2091)

Ihave summarized the content of the above listed video files below:

Brenda Landeros’ Video 000000
According to Detective Russell’s report, Brenda Landeros is an employee of the Days Inn and she
recorded a portion of the event on her cell phone from the front (or near the front) of the Days Inn Hotel.

The video clip is approximately 19 seconds in length and playback works best using QuickTime Player.
The video is poor quality and pixelated due to the distance Brenda Landeros was attempting to film
from.

At approximately the 00:006 mark: Decedent Chinedu Okobi can be seen standing up and running
backwards from the San Mateo County Sheriffs Deputies. Landeros then moves the cell phone
significantly, focusing on a pole momentarily and then shaking the phone while moving it. Another
person (a male subject) then steps in front of the cell phone and the video recording ends at the
approximate 19 second mark.

Days Inn Surveillance Video 20181003125953_20181003130241_2_20181011140707

The video clip is approximately 2 minutes and 49 seconds in length total. The camera is labeled
“Outside Garage” and the vantage point shows empty parking spaces in the underground parking garage
for the Days Inn along with a portion of El Camino Real in front of the Days Inn. The video featured the
date of 10-03-2018 and the video began at 12:59:53 pm.

At approximately the 00:001 mark: Decedent Chinedu Okobi can be seen standing in the center
median of El Camino Real, appearing to walk across El Camino Real to the east side of the street.

At approximately the 00:004 mark: Decedent Okobi quickly changes directions, turns around and
crosses E] Camino Real through medium southbound traffic in a northwest direction.

Mayra Martinez Video Analysis

At approximately the 00:16 mark: A San Mateo County Sheriff's Office SUV drives northbound on
El Camino Real. (I believe this is SMCO SO patrol vehicle MB #10, driven by Deputy Joshua Wang).
It should be noted that a large wall blocks the camera from being able to see Decedent Okobi’s location
as the SMCO SO patrol vehicle passes northbound on El Camino Real.

At approximately the 00:23 mark: | Decedent Okobi can be seen in on the west sidewalk area in front
of Zorbas Pizza, located at 1567 El Camino Real.

At approximately the 00:25 mark: | Decedent Okobi can be seen starting to cross El] Camino Real in
medium traffic in a northeast direction.

At approximately the 00:31 mark: | Decedent Okobi disappears from camera view as he makes his way
to the center median area of El Camino Real, still walking in a northeast direction.

At approximately the 00:41 mark: | Decedent Okobi can be seen running back across El Camino Real
in medium traffic, in a southwest direction, back towards Zorbas Pizza. Decedent Okobi disappears
behind a large wall that blocks the camera view.

At approximately the 00:57 mark: | Decedent Okobi can be seen walking southbound on the sidewalk
on the west side of the street, close to Tri Counties Bank, located at 1551 El Camino Real.

At approximately the 00:59 mark: Deputy Wang’s patrol SUV can be seen traveling slowly
southbound on El Camino Real with the overhead rotating lights activated, directly behind Decedent
Okobi who continues to walk southbound on the sidewalk.

At approximately the 01:03 mark: | Deputy Demartini’s patrol SUV can be seen pulling up in front of
Tri Counties Bank, northbound in the southbound lanes. At the same time, Deputy Wang’s patrol SUV
can be seen pulling slowly to the right side of El Camino Real (southbound).

At approximately the 01:07 mark: Deputy Wang can be seen stopping his vehicle and exiting his
patrol SUV.

At approximately the 01:10 mark: © Deputy Wang can be seen running southbound towards the west
sidewalk area, in front of Tri Counties Bank.

Due to the distance from the Days Inn “Outside Garage” camera, very little of the remaining
footage is of much evidentiary value. In addition to the distance, Deputy Demartini’s patrol
vehicle blocks the view of the sidewalk area on the west side of the street and there is a significant
glare from the outside vantage point and large walls that obstruct the view.

According to Detective Ordone’s report, Mayra Martinez recorded a portion of the event on her cell
phone from near the front of Tri Counties Bank (also known as First American Bank) located at 1551 El
Camino Real.

IMG 2089 is approximately 41 seconds in length and playback works best in QuickTime Player.

The 41 second video begins after Decedent Okobi has been handcuffed and Okobi is propped up in a
sitting position against the knees of one of the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Deputies standing
behind him. A motor officer arrives on scene and is being directed by Sergeant Weidner to block off
traffic in the area.

IMG 2090 is approximately 23 seconds in length and playback works best in QuickTime Player. The
23 second video begins with Decedent Okobi still handcuffed and propped up in the same sitting
position against the knees of one of the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office Deputies.

IMG 2091 is approximately 12 seconds in length and playback works best in QuickTime Player.

The 12 second video begins with two ambulances stopped behind the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office
CSO pickup truck and the location where Decedent Okobi was handcuffed. The video simply shows
law enforcement officers, fire department and emergency medical (ambulance) personnel moving around
and getting a transport gurney from the rear of one of the ambulances.

Lisa A. Novak, commending Sergeant Weidner and seven other San Mateo County Sheriff's Office
members. The commendation from Judge Novak was a result of a jury trial in which an inmate was
accused of assaulting deputies while in custody. The event was captured on surveillance video and
Judge Novak wrote in her letter, “What I saw was a team of true professionals attempt to initially
diffuse the situation, then ultimately restrain the inmate and come to his aid. All of your officers were
highly professional and remained so during what was a volatile situation created by a very unstable
individual. Even though the inmate was hostile, discourteous, violent, irrational and emotional, every
member of the Sheriff's department treated him with respect in spite of the dangerous situation he
created. I commend each of the following members of your department.” (Followed by the list of 8 San
Mateo County Sheriff's Office employees).

SUPPLEMENT 26 - Interview of Mi'trease Johnson

80202

Investigation:

On November 6, 2018 at approximately 1645 hours, I received a voicemail message from Mi’trease
Johnson. Ms. Johnson identified herself as the mother of Chinedu Okobi’s 12 year old daughter,
Christina Okobi. Johnson stated that she and Christina live in Tennessee. She wanted to inquire about
aspects of the on-going investigation and about the possibility of getting certain personal items released
to Christina. Johnson provided a call back phone number of (615) 589-0678.

On November 7, 2018 at approximately 0940 hours, I attempted to call Mi’trease Johnson back. There
was no answer and the voicemail message was generic. I left a voicemail message asking Johnson to
call me back at her convenience. During the afternoon hours of November 7, 2018, Mi’trease Johnson
left me a voicemail message, asking me to call her on November 8, 2018 at approximately 3:30 pm
pacific time.

I called Mi’trease Johnson on November 8, 2018 at approximately 1530 hours. I spoke with Mi’trease
Johnson for approximately 34 minutes. The bulk of my conversation with Mi’trease Johnson was spent
answering questions she had about the investigative process, the timing of specific findings and the
release of personal property back to family members.

During the phone conversation, Mi’trease Johnson stated that Chinedu Okobi had been out to Nashville
to visit with their 12 year old daughter, Christina Okobi in May of 2018, around Mother’s Day.
Mi’trease Johnson said that Chinedu Okobi spent a few (possibly as many as 4 days) in Nashville and
that was the last time that she and Christina personally saw him.

Mi’trease Johnson said that she and Chinedu Okobi met in college and they were involved in a five year
long relationship, in which Christina was born out of. Mi’trease Johnson stated that she lived in various
parts of Northern California, including Pacifica, San Francisco and the East Bay, but she and Christina
have lived in Nashville, TN for approximately the last eight years. Mi’trease Johnson said that Christina
was Chinedu Okobi’s only child.

At approximately 31:20 into the conversation, Mi’trease Johnson stated that she would let “her lawyer”
speak on her behalf when deciding to provide any information about Chinedu Okobi’s mental health
status. I informed Mi’trease Johnson that I was unaware that she had personally retained an attorney and
I was under the impression (based upon statements she made earlier in the conversation) that she had
retained an attorney to represent Christina Okobi (her 12 year old daughter) in a possible civil suit. I
explained to Mi’trease Johnson that if she or her attorney, whom she identified as Carl Douglas, wished
to provide additional information about Mr. Okobi, they could contact me directly. Mi’trease Johnson
stated that Mr. Douglas was aware that she had called the San Mateo County Coroner’s Office and he
was also aware that the San Mateo County Coroner’s Office had directed her to call the San Mateo
County District Attorney’s Office.

The MAV video begins with Deputy Wang making a U-turn from northbound El Camino
Real (SR 82) at the intersection of Park Boulevard, to southbound El Camino Real.
Deputy Wang travels southbound El Camino Real in the #3 (far nght) lane.

Deputy Wang approaches the intersection of Capuchino Drive (Kelly Moore Paints can
be seen on the right) while traveling in the #3 lane, Decedent Chinedu Okobi can be seen
walking from the northwest comer of Millwood (closest to Chapel of the Highlands)
across E] Camino Real (eastbound). It should be noted at that intersection the pedestrian
crosswalk is located on the south side of the intersection not where Decedent Okobi was
entering the roadway.

The traffic signal facing Deputy Wang as he travels southbound El Camino Real at
Millwood is green. As Decedent Okobi walks into lane #3, a vehicle travelling
southbound in lane #2 is approaching the intersection and the vehicle’s brake lights are
activated. The vehicle slows but continues through the intersection and passed Decedent
Okobi. Decedent Okobi continues eastbound and walks into lane #2 as the traffic light
for southbound El Camino changes to yellow (13:00:03). As Decedent Okobi walks from
lane #2 to lane #1 the light turns from yellow to red (13:00:06). At this point the only
vehicle approaching the intersection southbound is Deputy Wang’s.

Decedent Okobi steps onto the center median and then walks across #1,2, and 3 lane of
northbound traffic which has stopped for the red traffic light. However, two vehicles
enters the intersection making a left turn from Millwood onto northbound SR82, both
stop for Decedent Okobi (13:00:14).

Deputy Wang moves into southbound lane #1, once the traffic light turns green for
southbound traffic Deputy Wang makes a U-turn after activating his emergency lights.

Deputy Wang completes the U-turn and Decedent Okobi is walking in the northbound
traffic lane #3, facing northbound, heading towards the eastern sidewalk. Decedent
Okobi’s route to the sidewalk was not direct but rather an angle approach across traffic
lanes in a northerly direction.

13:00:31 Deputy Wang pulls alongside of Decedent Okobi just prior to the San Juan and SR 82
intersection. Deputy Wang lowers his window and states “Hey, hold up a minute” “Hold
up a minute”. Decedent Okobi is not seen in view of the MAV but Deputy Wang does
not exit his vehicle.

13:00:41 Deputy Wang continues northbound and pulls to the north side of San Juan and SR 82
intersection and to the curb. It sounds like Deputy Wang exits his vehicle. Stating “Hey,
stop”. Traffic is moderate in both directions on SR 82 at the time.

13:00:47 Deputy Wang gets in his vehicle and starts to move from the curb line, but passing traffic
causes him to wait.

13:00:59: Deputy Wang’s vehicle is angled in lane #3 of northbound SR82, facing in a slight
northwestern direction. The MAV picks up Decedent Okobi as he is now in the center
median walking northbound. Deputy Wang contacts County Communication over the
radio and states “County, Boy 62”.

13:01:09 Deputy Wang starts to move his vehicle forward as Decedent Okobi walks west across
northbound lanes #1, 2, and 3. Decedent Okobi reaches the western sidewalk as
southbound traffic approaches the area.

13:01:10 Deputy Wang advises County Communications “Can you put me on a ped stop at ECR
and Capuchino and can you role me one more unit please”.

13:01:15 Deputy Wang drives to the Capuchino and SR 82 intersection, northbound, making a U-
turn, to southbound SR82.

13:01:26 Deputy Wang stops his vehicle and advises County Communications “and if you could
send them Code 3, he’s running on ECR into traffic”. Decedent Okobi is seen moving in
a southerly direction in the left tur stack lane for northbound traffic as a vehicle
approaches northbound in lane #3. Decedent Okobi is looking towards Deputy Wang’s
vehicle then turns and walks towards the eastern sidewalk.

13:01:41 Deputy Wang makes a U-turn and is now travelling northbound on SR82 at Capuchino.

13:01:47 Deputy Wang appears to be in the process of making another U-turn onto southbound
SR82 at the same location when Decedent Okobi is seen running at the Capuchino and
SR 82 intersection, northbound, across the southbound #2 and #3 lane of traffic. Several
vehicles southbound on SR82 have to stop to avoid striking decedent Okobi.

13:03:57 Deputy Wang and Deputy DeMartini run to assist Deputy Lorenzatti. Decedent Okobi
raises his hands and continues to walk away.

13:04:02 Deputy Lorenzatti grabs the Decedents arm and states “Stop resisting”. Deputy Wang
states “You are going to get Tased, get on the ground, now!” A struggle ensues between
the Deputies and Decedent Okobi. Due to the distance of the MAV camera it is difficult
to see who is grabbing the decedent Okobi but Decedent Okobi is resisting their efforts
and is trying to pull away from the deputy’s control.

13:04:05 Decedent Okobi backs onto the street while a deputy holds onto his jacket arm, stretching
the jacket arm until the jacket comes off of Decedent Okobi.

13:04:13 Decedent Okobi frees himself from deputies grip and turns to run southbound SR82 in
the southbound lane #3. At which time Deputy Wang fires his Taser at Decedent Okobi.
Decedent Okobi is seen falling forward on the ground. A deputy is yelling “on the
ground, get on the ground”.

13:04:17 Decedent Okobi is on his back with legs and arms extended. Deputy Wang advises
County Communications “Give me a Code 33, we have a Taser deployment”. Deputies
are giving Decedent Okobi commands “role over on your stomach, now” several deputies
are giving the same commands.

13:04:30 Deputy Wang advises over radio “second Taser deployment”. Decedent Okobi is on his
back but is not complying with deputy’s orders to roll onto his stomach.

13:04:40 Decedent Okobi is yelling, stating “what did I do”, Deputy Wang gives a command “I am
going to Tase you again if you do not roll over on your stomach”. Continual commands
are being given to Decedent Okobi, Decedent Okobi does not appear to be following the
commands. Decedent Okobi yells each time he is Tased.

13:04:47. Deputy advises over the radio “Still resisting, third Taser deployed”. Commands are
being given to Decedent Okobi, to roll over, to which he does not reply to. Deputies
begin to grab at Decedent Okobi. Decedent Okobi continues to resist their attempt to
control him and moves his arms away from their reach.

activated). Deputy Wang advises County Communications “Boy 62, can you roll
medical”.

13:05:35 Decedent Okobi stands up and starts to jog away from the deputies, east across the south
and northbound lanes of SR82 with deputies following. The Taser can be heard
activating, based on the sound of the activation it was apparent that the Taser was no
longer fully connected to Decedent Okobi. A deputy states “Turn the Taser off”.

13:05:56 Although, out of MAV view deputies are heard issuing orders to Decedent Okobi,
advising him to get on the ground. The sound of a struggle and grunting can be heard but
no visual of the struggle can be seen on Deputy Wang’s MAV.

13:06:15 Deputy states, “Stop resisting now” another deputy states “Stay on top of him”, then
“give me your hand”.

Decedent Okobi is on the west sidewalk walking south, Decedent Okobi has his hands
out away from his body and then raises them up over his head. Deputy Lorenzatti is
approaching the decedent Okobi on foot and grabs for Decedent Okobi’s left hand but
Decedent Okobi pulls away. Deputy Wang and Deputy DeMartini run to Deputy
Lorenzatti’s assistance.

13:04:05 Deputy Lorenzatti’s patrol vehicle is parked to the front and left of Sergeant Weidner’s
vehicle and is limiting the MAV view of what is occurring on the sidewalk.

13:04:10 Sergeant Weidner runs to assist, as Decedent Okobi frees himself from contact with the
other deputies. Decedent Okobi starts to run away with Deputy Wang several steps
behind him. Decedent Okobi then turns and runs towards Deputy Wang and Deputy
Wang points his Taser at Decedent Okobi. Decedent Okobi continues to run towards
Deputy Wang as Deputy Wang backs up. Decedent Okobi raises his hands towards
Deputy Wang at which time Deputy Wang fires his Taser at Decedent Okobi. Decedent
Okobi takes a few steps towards Deputy Wang and then steps away and falls to the
ground. The deputies are ordering Decedent Okobi to roll onto his stomach.

Sergeant Weidner and Deputy Lorenzatti have their Tasers out as they order Decedent
Okobi to roll over (onto his stomach). Deputy Lorenzatti holsters her Taser and attempts
to place a control hold on Decedent Okobi’s right hand, unsuccessfully. She then moves
to Decedent Okobi’s left hand. Deputy Lorenzatti attempts to move Decedent Okobi onto
his stomach, as Sergeant Weidner and Deputy DeMartini try and control Decedent Okobi
legs. Decedent Okobi breaks free of Deputy Lorenzatti’s hold and kicks at Sergeant
Weidner and Deputy DeMartini causing them to move back.

13:04:25 Deputy Wang orders Decedent Okobi to roll over and warns him of another Taser
activation. Deputy Wang then appears to activate the Taser a second time.

13:04:33 Decedent Okobi is on his back and the deputies are continuously ordering him to roll
over. Decedent Okobi yells “what I do”. Sergeant Weidner states “Sir, roll over on your
stomach”. The deputies again give Decedent Okobi commands to get on his stomach.
Decedent Okobi fails to comply and kicks towards the deputies. Deputy Wang appears to
activate the Taser for a third time (13:04:40).

13:04:48 Decedent Okobi states “get them off me” (referring to the Taser barbs). Sergeant

stomach. Sergeant Weidner continues to state he will “take these out” (referring to the
barbs) if Decedent Okobi rolls onto his stomach.

13:05:11 As Sergeant Weidner tells Decedent Okobi that he will remove the barbs, Decedent
Okobi begins to sit up and get up off of the ground. The deputies tell Decedent Okobi to
remain on the ground.

13:05:16 As Decedent Okobi gets to his feet and takes a step Deputy Wang appears to activate his
Taser a fourth time and Decedent Okobi again falls to the ground, however, the Taser is
making an arcing sound which suggests incomplete contact. Decedent Okobi states
“somebody help me”. The deputies continue to order Decedent Okobi to roll onto his
stomach.

13:05:24 Decedent Okobi gets to his feet again but falls to the ground and yells “somebody help
me”. This appears to be when Deputy Wang activated his Taser a fifth time, but again
the Taser is making an arcing sound which suggests incomplete contact.

Deputy Watt also has expanded his collapsible baton.

13:05:36 Decedent Okobi starts to jog eastbound across SR82. Deputy Wang has activated the

Again the Taser is making an arcing sound which suggests incomplete contact.

13:04:48 Decedent Okobi and the deputies are out of view of the MAV, however, the sound is still
working. A seventh Taser activation is heard and orders are given to Decedent Okobi to
get on the ground. Sergeant Weidner tells Deputy Wang to turn the Taser off. (Based on
the noise the Taser was emitting it appears that activation four, five, six and seven were
ineffective possibly due to a barb being dislodged).

13:06:07 Sergeant Weidner requested via County Communications additional “Code 3 cover”
units.

13:06:18 Sergeant Weidner tells the deputies “stay on top of him, stay on top of him, watch out
he’s bleeding”. Sergeant Weidner continues to tell Decedent Okobi to give him his
hands. Sergeant Weidner asks for handcuffs. A deputy states “I’m out” another deputy

SUPPLEMENT 28 - Background of Decedent Chinedu Okobi io

On November 16, 2018, DAI Maher and I met with OKOBI’s mother, Maureen Okobi, his sister Ebele
Okobi, additional extended family members and the Okobis’ counsel. Ebele responded to questions
asked about OKOBI’s background. Most of Ebele’s responses coincided with the information above.
However, Ebele did provide additional information, regarding OKOBI’s background as noted below:

* OKOBI was born at San Francisco Children’s Hospital.

* OKOBI liked to write poetry and participated in “spoken word” performances.

* Prior to his first episode of mental illness, OKOBI was preparing to take the GMAT for graduate
school.

* After his first known episode of mental illness, that occurred within the Morehouse library, OKOBI
was taken to a hospital in Atlanta for treatment.

* Ebele stated that OKOBI struggled to have his mental illness properly diagnosed. In fact, Ebele
advised it took OKOBI years to be have access to the right medication but when he did, he stopped
“hearing voices” from inside of his head.

* Ebele advised that proper medical assessments and medication was obtained by OKOBI through the
Pathways program. Ebele noted that while this medication was effective in assisting with OKOBI’s

mental health issues, it also removed his ambitious nature.

Ebele advised that OKOBI did not attend the annual family holiday event in December of 2017. Ebele
stated that OKOBI's absence indicated to the family that he may have stopped taking his medication as it

was very unusual for him to miss such an event. Ebele went on to say her contact with OKOBI after

December of 2017 was seldom. Ebele’s mother, Maureen, advised she last communicated with OKOBI
several weeks prior to his death. During this communication they exchanged pleasant text messages

between the two of them and she did not suspect anything was amiss.

When asked if any of the family members knew why OKOBI was in Millbrae on the day he died, no one
could provide a reason why. Ebele suggested OKOBI may have been in Millbrae trying to obtain some
sort of social service. Ebele explained that after OKOBI died, she received a call from someone who

works at the Daly City Community Service Center:

The Service Center employee recognized OKOBI’s name from the news reports of his death and

contacted Ebele to inform her that OKOBI had been a current client of theirs. Ebele stated this

employee advised her that OKOBI had used the Service Center for housing purposes as well as a

assistance in getting back on his medication.

The interview with the Okobi family ended with Ebele stating her brother had a very strong fear of law
enforcement and was terrified of getting into trouble. When asked to elaborate as to why OKOBI had a
fear of law enforcement, Ebele stated OKOBI didn’t suffer any specific incident, or triggering event, to
cause him fear. She added that he was a large statured African American male living in the United

States, so it was natural for him to be fearful of the police.

Purpose

The purpose of this supplemental report is to summarize the operation of the Axon Enterprise Inc.
- Taser X26P and the examination of the evidentiary data retained by the actual device deployed
by Deputy Wang in this incident.

For Reference

For reference in this report, “electricity” is the flow of electrons through a conductor, such as a
wire. This concept is best understood when compared to water flowing through a pipe. The water
pressure in the pipe is comparable to the voltage, or volts. The actual volume of water flowing
through the pipe is similar to the amperes, or amps. Then to calculate wattage, or watts, one
would multiply volts to amps which equals a measure of how much power the circuit can deliver
in one second. For example, this is similar to when a flow of water is routed to turn a mill wheel
or turbine, whereby a small volume and flow of water would turn the wheel much slower than a
larger and faster volume flow.

The Taser X26P — Use and Operation

The Taser Conductive Energy Weapon (CEW) used in this incident by Deputy Wang was a Taser
X26P, a law enforcement specific CEW produced by Axon Enterprise Inc. When deployed, the
weapon is held and aimed similar to a firearm and is equipped with a thumb safety, trigger, and
sighting mechanism which includes a red LED “laser” for sight aiming and 2 low intensity white
LEDs for illumination. The device is armed by attaching a cartridge to the end of the barrel that
contains two sharp metal probes that once propelled by a pull of the trigger, can deliver a charge
to the target that can potentially cause neuro-muscular incapacitation, depending on extenuating
circumstances, to be described later in this report.

Once the Taser X26P is armed with a fresh cartridge, the user deactivates the thumb safety, aims
the device at the target subject, and pulls the trigger to propel the probes, which can be deployed
to a maximum of 25 feet. Once the probes are deployed, a second pull of the trigger will merely
send another charge into these same probes. In both cases, if the trigger is pulled and released, the
device defaults to a 5 second activation, which can be shortened if the manual thumb safety is
activated. If the user instead holds down the trigger, the device will continue to charge until the
trigger is released, allowing for an extended activation. (For clarification, this incident does NOT
include any such activation in that only deployments of 5 seconds or less occurred during the
altercation.)

The probes themselves have sharp barbed tips designed to penetrate the outer surface of the target
and remain intact as the charge is delivered. The charge from the Taser is ONLY delivered if
BOTH probes are connected, which completes the circuit as the charge “arcs” between the probes,
completing the “loop” formed by both probes being connected to the target and their wires still
being connected to the cartridge on the Taser. The electrical charge delivered by the Taser X26P
is approximately .0012 amperes. For a frame of reference, a standard wall outlet delivers 16
amperes while a common C7 Christmas tree bulb requires just 1 ampere to illuminate.

J Arcing Probes

The probes are deployed from the device whereby the top probe is propelled parallel to the top of
the Taser and the bottom probe is propelled at an 8 degree downward angle. The greater the
distance or “spread” between the two probes upon contact, the greater the surface area between
the probes, thus increasing the chance that the charge will cause Neuro-muscular Incapacitation
(NMD,, or “body lock up”. However, it’s important to note that the charge travels or “arcs” only

3
between the connected probes and the path of that arc can be adversely affected by thick clothing,
poor probe contact, etc. For instance, the charge can potentially arc through a thick cotton jacket
while the target subject himself feels little or no effects from the charge. The fact that the arcing
of the charge only travels between the probes is why additional persons can safely touch the target
subject WHILE he or she is being Tased and not feel the effects of the Taser, unless they
inadvertently touch the probes or the wires. This fact is also why a subject can maintain control
and/or use of any limbs that are NOT affected by the Taser while being Tased, especially in the
case of an up close encounter deployment that results in a short spread and typically no NMI. Thus
the most effective deployment range of a Taser X26P is reported to be 14 to 25 feet, allowing for
a sufficient spread between the probes most likely to cause NMI once the circuit is complete.

Once the probes are deployed and with a completed, or “closed” circuit, the Taser X26P delivers
approximately 19 pulses of electricity per second, abbreviated as PPS. However, if the circuit is
NOT completed, such as when one of the probes is not connected or misses the target, the Taser
X26P will internally detect this “open” circuit and immediately reduce the charge to approximately
9 PPS. This is to not only save battery power but also designed by Axon to improve service life of
the device.

Lastly, an alternate use for the X26P is a “drive stun”, where the barrel end or tip of the Taser is
pushed directly onto a person, which alone will NOT cause NMI. This is designed only as a pain
compliance technique. This is done by either first removing the cartridge or by “driving” the
previously deployed cartridge against the target’s body and pulling the trigger. The metal diodes
that are exposed by either removing the cartridge or after the probes are deployed, complete their

4
own circuit and deliver a charge that causes pain to the subject. However, if the probes have been
deployed, and at least one probe is still connected to the target subject, AND the
corresponding wire is intact, a drive stun can be used to complete the circuit, causing a “spread”
between the single connected probe and the point of the drive stun. If this is done so with a
sufficient spread between the two points, NMI can occur. For example, in the instance when a
Taser is deployed and one of the probes misses the target, the circuit will remain “open” and thus
the charge will not be delivered. The user can then engage the target subject by delivering a drive
stun, thus closing the aforementioned open circuit between the single connected probe and the
point of the drive stun, potentially delivering a charge to the target that could cause NMI. (Again,
this tactic is NOT pertinent to the investigation at hand, but offered here to better clarify how the
device works. A video example of this tactic produced by Axon Enterprise, Inc. was retained as a
reference in this case, titled “Drive Stun Follow Up”.)

Taser X26P — Event Logs and Pulse Graphs

Local Time Duration Sat Remaining
[dd:mm::yyyy Hr-min: Sec] fevent Type] aa a | Celsius)

 

The Taser X26P is equipped with an internal flash memory that records any activation of the
device. This “Event Log” includes the time stamp and/or duration of a deployment, as well as the
event type. For instance, when an officer merely deactivates the thumb safety to check the battery
life for the device at the start of their shift, this event is preserved. If the Taser is deployed by the
press of the trigger, whether to deploy the probes or re-engage previously deployed probes, the
event type is preserved in the memory as “Trigger” and the log includes the date and time of the
event, the duration in seconds of the deployment, and the remaining battery life in the device at
the time of that event. The contents of the internal memory of the Taser X26P is downloaded to a
PC via a proprietary USB adapter and using software branded as Evidence Sync by Axon
Enterprise Inc.

Once the Taser is attached to the USB cable and plugged into a PC, Evidence Sync will acquire
the contents and prepare an “Event Log” that is retained as a PDF. The Event Log itself can be
scaled down using a series of filters, such as acquiring only events in a given time period.

As it relates to this incident and as previously noted in a supplemental report by Senior Inspector
Bill Massey, it is important to note that each Taser X26P maintains its own internal clock and in
cases such as this, it is common to see a variation in time between the actual time and date when
an event occurred and that which is noted on the Event Log. The Taser X26P will only update its
internal clock and complete a “time sync” AFTER data is downloaded to Evidence Sync. Prior to
this event, the last time sync completed on Deputy Wang’s Taser was October 2", 2017.

Using Evidence Sync the user can also acquire a “Pulse Log” for an event triggered by a pull of
the trigger. This log generates three dotted lines showing various measurements of the event itself,
spreading horizontally across the graph and delineated vertically to represent time in seconds. The
left vertical margin measures the voltage and the right horizontal margin measures the
microcoulumbs, which is a unit to represent a very small amount of electricity. (4 coulomb is a
charge equal to the amount of electricity conveyed in one second by a one amp current. A
microcoulomb is 1/1,000,000 of a coulomb.)

For our purposes, the purple line, or “Arc” has no investigative value, and merely represents that
the device is functioning in a manner that could potentially create an arc between the probes. The
blue dotted line, the “Charge” indicates whether or not the circuit was complete (both probes
connected) AND if the circuit was sufficient to maintain the optimum charge of 63 microcoulombs,
which Axon Enterprise Inc. has identified as the optimal charge to cause NMI to the target subject.
If for instance the circuit is open or incomplete (such as one or more disconnected probes), the
blue line will drop down near 0 volts and charge, representing the reduction in PPS as explained
earlier in this report. The green dotted line, or “Stim” (Stimulation) represents the voltage, which
reflects the ongoing effort of the Taser X26P to “push” the flow of power faster or slower (recalling
the comparison to water pressure) in an effort to create an arc of the optimum 63 microcoulombs.
In regards to the vertical time increments, note that the device measures and records each of these
values approximately 20 times per second.
Lastly, as noted in the footnote for each graph, NONE of the reflected data indicates the actual
voltage or charge delivered to the target subject. Thus, it offers NO indication that the deployment
was effective, but rather only if the circuit was completed and the optimum charge was reached by
the device. In layman terms, nothing in the graph reflects whether or not the target subject felt the
effects of the Taser X26P.

For the purpose of this investigation, I used Evidence Sync and the necessary USB cable to analyze
Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P, specifically the Event Log for the time period in question and the
Pulse Logs for the individual activations. My analysis is as follows:

The above Event Log represents the seven (7) activations that occurred during this incident,
whereby the trigger was pulled, causing the device to then attempt to close the circuit in each
instance and deliver the necessary charge to possibly incapacitate the Decedent. As stated
previously, all 7 occurrences lasted 5 seconds or less, as indicated in the “Duration” column. This
in turn allowed me to generate a pulse graph for each occurrence.

The pulse graph for activation #1 indicates a 5 second activation consisting of a completed circuit
that delivered the necessary charge (approx. 63 microcoulombs) to potentially cause NMI, noting
that at the 2.2 second mark the charge briefly spiked upwards, causing the device to reduce the
voltage (green dots) in order to return the charge (blue dots) to the appropriate level. This graph
reflects that the Taser is functioning in a closed circuit and in a manner that could debilitate the

The pulse graph for activation #4 indicates a 5 second activation whereby the circuit is open and
incomplete for the first 3 seconds, causing the device to immediately reduce the charge to near
zero (0) as the voltage spiked and remained at 3000 volts in an effort to complete the circuit (create
an arc between the probes). This was possibly due to a disconnected probe or wire. At the 3.1
second mark, the charge spikes to just below 50 microcoulombs and remains sporadic as the volts
remain maximized, with the device still struggling to complete the circuit. This graph represents
an unsuccessful and ineffective deployment of the Taser where the device struggled to close the
circuit, including the final 1.3 seconds when the charge remained well below 50 microcoulombs
and thus never sufficient to cause NMI.

On 11-9-18, following my own analysis, I presented this pulse graph to Bryan Chiles, Product
Compliance Manager for Axon Enteprise Inc. and a previously recognized expert witness in the
Taser pulse graphs. I asked him, “Looking at just the graph, it’s not likely that this activation had
any effect on him?” He replied, “Guaranteed no effect for the first 3 seconds...but he or someone
else may have laid on the wire and briefly felt something from it (in the final 2 seconds)...but
definitely not NMI. I don’t know if it arced on him (the Decedent’s person).” Jn conjunction with
the available video of the event, the Decedent may have briefly turned into the wire with this arm
and felt some noticeable effect from the charge.

The pulse graph for activation #6 indicates a 5 second activation whereby the circuit was closed,
but the charge was sporadic throughout the deployment as the voltage remained maximized in an
effort to create a consistent arcing circuit. The charge itself also with rare exception remained well
below the 63 microcoulombs threshold necessary to cause NMI and/or have any physical effect on
the target subject.

During my initial analysis of activation #6, it was my opinion that the charge was likely arcing at
the barrel end of the Taser (similar to a drive stun), rather than between the probes, possibly due
to one or more broken wires and thus having no physical effect on the Decedent. On 11-9-18, I
presented this pulse graph to Brian Chiles. He added, “The weapon is arcing and you can probably
hear it (which is consistent with the available video),” but it was his opinion that the charge was
more likely arching between crossed wires. He also agreed that regardless of which of the above
scenarios led to the above data, this graph still represents an unsuccessful and ineffective
deployment of the Taser where the charge is clearly, “not arcing to a person.” He expanded on
this, saying, ““When the device is arching in error, (the charge) is variable,” and appears sporadic
as it does in this graph.

The pulse graph for activation #7 is similar to that of #6, indicating a 5 second activation whereby
the circuit was closed, but the charge remained sporadic throughout the deployment as the voltage
remained maximized in an effort to create a consistent arcing circuit. The charge again with rare
exception remained well below the 63 microcoulombs threshold necessary to cause NMI and/or
have any physical effect on the target subject. On 11-9-18, when presented with this graph, Chiles
again agreed with my assessment that the pulse graph for activation #7 represents an unsuccessful
and ineffective deployment of the Taser where the charge is not arcing properly, either due to
broken or crossed wires.

Lastly, and upon completion of my above analysis, I personally activated Wang’s Taser X26P for

cartridge still engaged on the device. I was able to replicate the results explained above for
activations #6 and 7, validating the analysis of the activations in question. The chart is presented

Conclusion

Based on my training and experience in both the personal use and deployment of a Taser CEW,
my own discussions with various persons including Brian Chiles of Taser Enterprise Inc. who are
familiar with the operation of the Taser X26P, and on my own analysis of the Event Log and Pulse
Logs retained by Deputy Wang’s Taser X26P for this incident, it appears the circuit was closed
and operating efficiently during activations #1, #2, and #3, delivering a charge via a closed circuit
at a level and in a manner that could have had a physical effect on the Decedent and/or caused
some level of NMI. With the exception of the final 1.8 seconds of activation #4, it is also my
opinion that deployment #4, 5, 6, and 7 had no physical effect (no NMI) on the Decedent for the
reasons described above for each individual activation based on the related pulse graph data.

involved incident involving deputies from the San Mateo County Sherriff’s Office and Chinedu Okobi.
I arrived at scene at approximately 2:50 PM, reported to the command post, and was assigned to the
crime scene. I remained at the crime scene until all available evidence was collected and the roadway
reopened.

INVESTIGATION:

On October 3, 2018, at 2:20 PM, I responded to El Camino Real and Millwood to assist in an officer
involved incident involving deputies from the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office and Chinedu Okobi.
Prior to my arrival Okobi and Deputy Joshua Wang were transported to Mills-Peninsula Hospital for
additional treatment and care. Deputy Wang was released from the hospital after receiving treatment for
his injuries. Life-saving measures were taken to revive Okobi, but he was pronounced deceased at the
hospital. I arrived at scene at approximately 2:50 PM, reported to the command post, and was assigned
to the crime scene by Sr. Inspector Bill Massey. San Mateo County Sheriff's Sgt. Trickett was the
Incident Commander at the scene. He identified the involved parties and debriefed the incident. Sgt.
Trickett also walked us through the crime scene.

Involved Parties:

Sergeant David Weidner

The incident initiated south of the intersection of Capuchino Dr. However, the main body of evidence is
located on El Camino Real between Capuchino Dr. and Santa Helena Ave.

Upon my arrival, El Camino Real was closed to through traffic from Millwood Dr. to Park Blvd. The
scene was secured with crime scene tape, cones, signs, patrol vehicles, and patrol personnel.

At 10:04 PM Sergeant Weidner, Deputy Lorenzatti, and Deputy Watt were escorted to their respective
patrol vehicles and allowed to remove personal items from the scene.

All of the patrol vehicles were removed from the crime scene by the Sheriff's department, the crime
scene broken down, and the roadway reopened at approximately 11:08 PM.

Vehicles:

Vehicle #8 was driven by Deputy Alyssa Lorenzatti. This vehicle was located in the #1 lane on south
bound El Camino Real. It was facing south and near the intersection of Capuchino Dr.

Vehicle #37 was driven by Deputy Bryan West. This vehicle was located in the #3 lane on south bound
El Camino Real. It was facing north and was south of Santa Helena Ave.

Vehicle #1 was driven by Sergeant Weidner. This vehicle was also located in the #3 lane on south
bound El Camino Real. It was facing north, south of Santa Helena Ave, and east of Vehicle #37.
Vehicle #10 was driven by Deputy Wang. This vehicle was located in the #3 lane of north bound El
Camino Real. It was facing south in the roadway north of Santa Helena Ave.

Vehicle #115 is a utility truck and was driven by CSO Joseph Gonzales. This vehicle was located in the
# 2 lane on north bound El Camino Real. It was facing north and west of Vehicle #10.

Vehicle #16 was driven by Deputy Demartini. It was moved from the scene prior to my arrival and
parked at the Millbrae substation located at 581 Magnolia Ave.

All of the vehicles were marked and clearly identifiable as Police vehicles. The red and blue lights had
been activated during this incident.

The patrol vehicles are equipped with MVAR’s.

I visually inspected each vehicle. They did not appear to be damaged. I also looked inside each vehicle
and did not find anything out of the ordinary.

Evidence:

See the crime lab reports for specific evidence collected at scene. Criminalists Anzalone and Delmonico
photographed, measured, and diagrammed the scene with the assistance of a 3D scanner. Some of the
evidence they collected at the scene included:

-Personal items that appear to belong to Okobi.

-Taser (CEW), cartridge, wires, miscellaneous parts.

-White Towel

-ASP retractable baton.

-OPA: Oralpharyngeal Airway used by EMS at scene.

-Photographs of Deputy Wang’s duty belt and weapon were taken at scene. There were no reports or
evidence that a firearm was used during this incident, but each magazine was inspected and counted.
There were 17 bullets in each magazine. One bullet was removed from the chamber.

Tri Counties Bank:

Some of the evidence listed above was located at scene in front of Tri Counties Bank located at 1551 El
Camino Real. There is an ATM located near the northeast corner of the building with an internal camera
that might have captured part of this incident. I went inside Tri Counties Bank and met Hilda Delgado
who is the Vice President - Branch Manager. Delgado was not at the bank during this incident. I asked
Delgado if she could assist me with the retrieval of the video from the ATM. She contacted Bob Collins
from security and he asked to speak with me directly. Collins told me he would be unable to assist me at
this time and referred me to Richard Ellena. I called Ellena who told me he would retrieve the recording
and send it to me via e-mail.

On October 4, 2018, I received an email from Ellena with ten (10) separate recordings from the ATM.
Ellena advised that a VLC Media player would be needed in order to play back the recordings. I
provided a copy of the recordings to the primary investigators assigned to this case for review. There
was a report a customer being present at the ATM during this incident. I asked Ellena if he could verify
this information and provide me with the identity of the customer. He told me he could provide me with
the identity of the customer, but he would need a court order to release the customer’s information.

SUPPLEMENT 31 - Autopsy of Chinedu Okobi

Investigation:
On October 4, 2018, at 11:30 AM, I responded to San Mateo General Hospital located at 222 W 39% St

in San Mateo for the autopsy of Chinedu Okobi. Dr. Thomas Rogers performed the autopsy and
Cruminalist Michael Fish was present from the crime lab. Dr. Rogers told me that Okobi appeared to
have had cardiovascular disease and an enlarged heart. He had abrasions on his right hand and left
elbow, but did not appear to have any other external or internal injuries consistent with trauma. Dr.
Rogers explained that his wrists had internal bruising that is typical with someone who has been
handcuffed. Okobi’s trachea, neck, and airway did not show any of the typical signs of injury that can
been seen when a carotid restraint is applied. However, Okobi did exhibit signs of petechaie in his eyes.
Dr. Rogers located one taser probe in Okobi’s right upper torso and a minor injury that could have been
caused by the impact of another probe on his right arm. Dr. Rogers advised that the toxicology results
will be included in his final report. See his report for further details.

I collected 19 items of evidence including bedding from Mills-Peninsula Hospital, personal clothing, a
taser probe, and biological evidence from Okobi. I individually packaged and sealed each item and
secured the evidence at the District Attorney’s office.

On October 5, 2018, I booked the items from the autopsy into evidence at the San Mateo County
Sherriff’s property unit. See the attached property report for a complete list.

Coroner’s Office:

On October 4, 2018, I met Coroner Investigator Heather Diaz at the Coroner’s Office and provided her
with an update. After our conversation she released Okobi’s cellular phone and a USB drive to me. I
secured each item in an evidence envelope (for safekeeping) and transported these items to the District
Attorney’s office to be booked into property.

Personal Property
On October 3, 2018, Inspector Draper retrieved Okobi’s personal items from the Millbrae substation.

These items were contained in two bags. On October 5, 2018, I inventoried the bags and booked them
into the Sheriff's Office property unit for safekeeping. I did not find anything of monetary value or
medications while conducting the inventory. I did find a copy of a Discharge Transition Plan from
Community Bridges, Inc. (CBD. Okobi is listed as the client. It is dated September 26, 2018. I
conducted a google search of CBI. I found website at _https://communitybridgesaz.org/ that matches
the paperwork I found. According to the website CBI is a non-profit organization that provides
medically integrated behavioral health programs.

I found two other items of interest. Okobi had a Community Information Handbook from the San Mateo
County Human Services Agency listing available resources. He also had a request for verification from
HSA with a listed address of 271 924 St., Daly City, CA 94015. The associated case number listed is
2008230.

SUPPLEMENT 32 - Interview of Witness Mark Gilbert

Summary:
On October 3, 2018, at 2:20 PM, I responded to El Camino Real and Millwood Dr. to assist in an officer

involved incident involving deputies from the San Mateo County Sherriff’s Office and Chinedu Okobi.
I arrived at scene at approximately 2:50 PM, reported to the command post, and was assigned to the
crime scene. I remained at the crime scene until all available evidence was collected and the roadway
reopened. During that time I met with Mark Gilbert who did not see any of the events leading to
Okobi’s arrest. He did provide the following paraphrased statement based upon what he saw after Okobi
was handcuffed. This conversation was recorded with his knowledge.

Statement of Witness Mark Gilbert:

Mark Gilbert is the store manager at Kelly-More Paints located at 1497 El Camino Real. Gilbert said he
saw bits and pieces of what occurred. Gilbert was working at the main counter, inside the store, which
is located approximately 20 feet west from the front door and in the center of the store. He was helping
customers at the counter when he heard noises that sounded like a vehicle accident had occurred outside
on El Camino Real. He noticed traffic was starting to back up and he heard sirens. The store front has
glass windows and a glass door, but he could not see what was going on. He remained inside the store
and walked towards the northeast corner of the store to get a better look at what was going on. He was
standing approximately 8 feet north of the front door and looked outside through one of the front
windows. Things were getting chaotic and he thought he saw a total of 6 police vehicles. All the cars
came to a stop and things got quiet. He could not hear anything, but saw a large subject sitting on the
ground with his hands behind his back and several officers surrounding him.

Gilbert said the subject was sitting on the ground and in the north bound lanes on El Camino Real.
Gilbert said he was sitting near the white towel in the roadway which appeared to be near the #2 lane.
He told me his legs were positioned straight out in front of him. He was slouched forward, his mouth
open, and he appeared to be out of breath. He wasn’t moving much and didn’t appear to be saying
anything at this point. His hands were behind his back as if he was handcuffed but Gilbert did not see
the subject get handcuffed. The officers touched him several times as if they were checking to see if he
was ok.

There were approximately 4 uniformed officers around the subject and a couple more in the area. He
would not be able to identify the officers, but thought one officer might have been Hispanic and the
others White. The officers moved the subject out of the roadway and towards the sidewalk. Gilbert
thought the subject was trying to sit up at one point and thought he was having difficulty breathing.
There was one officer standing on his right, one on his left, and one directly behind him. The officers
placed their hands on him to keep him sitting on the ground. Gilbert told me he never saw the subject
stand up or get off the ground.

At that point Gilbert walked back to the counter to assist customers. On occasion he would leave the
front counter to check on the activities outside. He walked back and forth several times checking on the
activities outside. EMS personnel eventually took the subject from the scene.

SUPPLEMENT 32 - Interview of Witness Mark Gilbert

I asked Gilbert if there were any customers or employees who saw any part of the incident. He said he
did not know, but would check and get back to me.

Additional Information:

On October 12, 2018, I contacted Gilbert to obtain more information regarding the description of the
subject he saw on the ground and the subject’s actions while on the ground. Gilbert described then man
on the ground as a heavy set African-American male approximately 30-35 years old. Gilbert also
confirmed the subject was wearing a blue shirt and tan or khaki pants. Gilbert also added that he did not
know who the man was and has no personal relationship with him.

Gilbert also confirmed the position of the officers as noted in his original statement. He told me the
subject was not moving around very much. He said the subject was heavy and he thought he was sitting
forward in a way that would have made it difficult for him to breathe. I tried to clarify how far forward
he was sitting. He described it as sitting *%4 of the way up.

He said the man was slouched forward slightly and did not appear very alert. He did not seem to
respond much when the officers checked on him to see if he was alright. He almost seemed to be in an
unconscious state. Gilbert said he was trying to look at his eyes and see his expression, but he couldn’t
see his face or eyes very well. His said the man’s expression seemed blank. In summary, he confirmed
that the subject was slumped over and not moving much while he was looking at him from his vantage
point inside the store.

SUPPLEMENT 33 - City of Millbrae Traffic Enforcement

Investigation:
During my interview with Sergeant David Weidner on October 4, 2018, Sergeant Weidner discussed his

prior awareness of the portion of El Camino Real where this incident occurred and the fact that he
recognized it as being a “high traffic area”. Sergeant Weidner also talked about his knowledge of the
City of Millbrae having a high occurrence of traffic accidents in which pedestrians have been struck by
vehicles. Based upon this information, I researched San Mateo County Sheriff's Office press releases
available on the website related to traffic enforcement and significant traffic-related investigations
involving pedestrians.

I found three (3) press releases related to injury “hit and run” accidents involving vehicles and
pedestrians on El Camino Real in Millbrae. The first of these incidents was a fatal hit and run accident
involving a pedestrian which occurred on January 12, 2014 at the intersection of El Camino Real and
Millwood Drive. This is the same intersection Deputy Joshua Wang observed Decedent Chinedu Okobi
crossing east against a red light on October 3, 2018. The second incident occurred on March 29, 2016
and was a hit and run accident with injuries sustained by a pedestrian which occurred in the 500 block of
El Camino Real, approximately nine (9) blocks south of the intersection of El Camino Real and
Millwood Drive. The third incident occurred on April 13, 2018 and was a hit and run accident with
injuries sustained by a pedestrian which occurred in the area of El] Camino Real and Silva Avenue, also
approximately nine (9) blocks south of the intersection of El Camino Real and Millwood Drive. There
did not appear to be any press releases issued by the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office for pedestrian

related traffic accidents when either no injury occurred or there was no subsequent criminal investigation
stemming from the incident.

I also located six (6) press releases by either the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office or the City of
Millbrae regarding on-going traffic enforcement details related to pedestrian safety in the City of
Millbrae. The first press release was dated December 3, 2012 and covered the implementation of a
“pedestrian crosswalk safety program” along El Camino Real which was to continue until December 21,
2012. The press release stated the goal of the Sheriff's Office Millbrae Patrol Bureau during this
program was to raise awareness of both motorists and pedestrians. The increase in awareness was to be
done via a series of strategies including in part the issuance of verbal warnings to motorists and
pedestrians and the issuances of citations when appropriate. The release also discussed how the Millbrae
Patrol Bureau would be working closely with the City of Millbrae’s Traffic Engineering Department and
with Caltrans to “monitor and ensure pedestrian and motorist safety along the El Camino Real corridor”
in Millbrae.

The second press release was dated January 17, 2018 and was issued by the City of Millbrae. This
release covered activity by the San Mateo County Saturation Traffic Enforcement Program (STEP) set to
occur that date in the cities of Millbrae and Burlingame. The release noted this was the first of a series of
planned multi-agencies saturation deployments scheduled for 2018. The release noted the San Mateo
County Police Chiefs and Sheriff Association was working collectively to focus on reducing the number
of injuries and traffic accidents throughout San Mateo County. The release also included safety tips for

SUPPLEMENT 33 - City of Millbrae Traffic Enforcement

both drivers and pedestrians. Among the safety tips for pedestrians was “Be predictable. Follow the rules
of the road, cross at crosswalks or intersections, and obey signs and signals.”

The third press release was dated May 18, 2018 and documented a traffic enforcement operation set to
occur the same date. The stated goal of the enforcement detail was “focused enforcement on collision
causing factors involving motorists and pedestrians” which would be achieved via routine traffic patrols
focused on “trouble spots” on the El Camino Real corridor in Millbrae. The release additionally included
a passage which stated: “Deputies will be looking for traffic offenses made by drivers and pedestrians
alike that can lead to life changing injuries”. The release also stated “enforcement will be taken for
observed violations when pedestrians cross the street illegally or fail to yield to drivers who have the
right of way. Pedestrians should cross the street only in marked crosswalks or at comers”. The forth
press release was an after-operation summary for the May 18, 2018 deployment which was authored by
Sergeant David Weidner. During my research, I found that the May 18, 2018 enforcement operation was
featured on KRON 4 as part of their “People Behaving Badly” segment and was available for view on
their website. Reporter Stanley Roberts rode along with Sergeant Weidner during the deployment and
filmed the activities of the deputies. Among the enforcement stops featured during the segment was a
pedestrian being stopped and cited for crossing against a red traffic signal in the 600 block of El Camino
Real, approximately eight (8) blocks from the intersection of El Camino Real and Millwood Drive.

The final two (2) press releases were related to a special traffic enforcement detail scheduled for
September 28, 2018. The first of these releases, dated September 21, 2018, documented the plan to
conduct traffic safety enforcement in the cities of Millbrae and San Carlos. This memo included safety
tips for drivers and pedestrians similar to those listed in the January 17, 2018 press release issued by the
City of Millbrae. A safety tip listed for pedestrians included, “Follow the rules of the road, use
crosswalks or intersections, and obey signs and signals”. The second related release was dated October
1, 2018 and was the after-operation summary for the September 28, 2018 enforcement detail. This
release was issued two (2) days prior to the incident with Decedent Chinedu Okobi on October 3, 2018.

On November 26, 2018 I spoke via telephone with Captain Paul Kunkel of the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office regarding traffic related issues within the City of Millbrae. Captain Kunkel is currently
the Commander for the Millbrae Patrol Bureau and was assigned to his current assignment on September
11, 2018. Captain Kunkel told me there have “been a number” of injury accidents involving pedestrians
along the El Camino Real corridor in Millbrae that he is aware of since the San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office assumed police services for the city. Captain Kunkel said the Sheriff's Office has worked very
hard to mitigate the factors which have led to these accidents including working to educate the public,
utilizing stricter enforcement and working with City of Millbrae and Caltrans engineers to increase
pedestrian safety. Captain Kunkel told me from his previous employment as a police officer with the
City of Menlo Park, he knows the number one compliant from citizens to city officials are traffic related
complaints and traffic safety issues. Captain Kunkel said his experience with the City of Millbrae thus
far is consistent with this as well. Captain Kunkel said traffic speed and safety on the El Camino Real

SUPPLEMENT 33 - City of Millbrae Traffic Enforcement

on the El Camino Real corridor in Millbrae have been among the biggest complaints the Millbrae Patrol
Bureau has received. Captain Kunkel told me the portion of El Camino Real near Millwood Drive,
where the roadway has six (6) lanes of traffic, is among the widest points of El Camino Real as it
extends throughout the peninsula which may help contribute to increased traffic and traffic accidents
based upon the volume of vehicles passing through this area. Because of this, Captain Kunkel said he
has made traffic enforcement and pedestrian safety in Millbrae a point of emphasis with the Sergeants
and Deputies working under his command. Captain Kunkel cited the multiple special traffic enforcement
details and his expectation that the Deputies under his command conduct increased traffic enforcement
as some of the efforts being made to improve traffic safety in Millbrae. Captain Kunkel also noted
Caltrans and the City Engineers have worked to improve the safety of many crosswalks on El Camino
Real by adding High Intensity Activated Crosswalks (HAWKs) pedestrian crossing beacons because of
the high number of pedestrian related accidents.

On November 26, 2018 I spoke with Sergeant Jason Peardon with the San Mateo County Sheriff's
Office. Sergeant Peardon is currently one (1) of the supervisors for the Sheriff's Office Major Accident
Investigations Team (MAIT). Sergeant Peardon told me the El Camino Real corridor in Millbrae is the
most active stretch of roadway in Sheriff's Office jurisdiction for pedestrian related traffic accidents.
Sergeant Peardon said he was aware of at least eight (8) fatal or major injury accidents involving
pedestrians which his team has responded to on El Camino Real in Millbrae since the San Mateo County
Sheriff's Office began contracting police services for the City of Millbrae in 2012. Sergeant Peardon
said there are likely many more non-fatal accidents or accidents with less serious injuries involving
pedestrians in the same area during the time frame, but his team would not have responded to those
incidents. Sergeant Peardon provided me the locations for each of these eight (8) accidents and I noted
all eight (8) appeared to have been within approximately ten (10) blocks or less from the intersection of
El Camino Real and Millwood Drive. Two (2) of these incidents occurred at or near the intersection of
El Camino Real and Millwood Drive.

In reviewing information regarding the City of Millbrae, I noted the population for the city is currently
listed as approximately 22,500 residents. I also noted the El Camino Real corridor through the City of
Millbrae is approximately 1.5 miles in length. On November 27, 2018 Sergeant Jon Sebring provided
me a list of all pedestrian related traffic accidents which had been reported to have occurred in the 1.5
mile stretch of El Camino Real through the City of Millbrae since 2012. This list contained forty-eight
(48) pedestrian related traffic accidents on the El Camino Real corridor reported between October 2012
and July 2018. Of these forty-eight (48) pedestrian related accidents, four (4) were reported as fatalities
and fifteen (15) as “major injury”. Of these same forty-eight (48) accidents, the primary collision factor
in eleven (11) of the accidents was determined to be either jaywalking or pedestrian in the roadway
related violations. An additional twenty-eight (28) accidents listed a primary collision factor related to
drivers failing to yield to pedestrians in lawful crossing areas. In looking at the reported locations of the
forty-eight (48) pedestrian related accidents, I noted fourteen (14) appeared to have occurred within
approximately 2000 feet in either direction of the intersection of El Camino Real and Millwood Drive

related to jaywalking and pedestrians in the roadway. Sergeant Sebring also provided me with a list of
traffic citations issued by Deputy Joshua Wang for the past three (3) months. I noted that between July 3,
2018 and September 29, 2018, Deputy Wang issued forty-seven (47) citations for traffic related offenses.
Twenty-One (21) of these citations shown a location of occurrence on the El Camino Real corridor
