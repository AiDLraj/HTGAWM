PRELIMINARY ALLEGATIONS

15. The County of San Mateo is a public entity and is being sued under Title 42 U.S.C. §
1983 for violations of the United States Constitution for the acts and omissions of Defendants DOES
1-50, and each of them, who at the time they caused Plaintiff's and Decedent's injuries, damages and
death were duly appointed, qualified and acting officers, employees, and/or agents of County and
acting within the course and scope of their employment and/or agency.

16. Plaintiff alleges that the conduct of each defendant deprived Decedent of his
constitutional right to life and caused Decedent to suffer grievous harm prior to his death.

17. Each of the Defendants caused and is responsible for the unlawful conduct and
resulting harm by, inter alia, personally participating in the conduct, or acting jointly and in concert
with others who did so, by authorizing, acquiescing, condoning, acting, omitting or failing to take
action to prevent the unlawful conduct, by promulgating or failing to promulgate policies and
procedures pursuant to which the unlawful conduct occurred, by failing and refusing to initiate and
maintain proper and adequate policies, procedures and protocols, and by ratifying and condoning the
unlawful conduct performed by agents and officers under their direction and control.

18. Whenever and wherever reference is made in this Complaint to any act by Defendants
DOES 1-50, such allegations and references shall also be deemed to mean the acts and failures to act

of each DOE Defendants individually, jointly or severally.

MONELL ALLEGATIONS
19. Based upon the principles set forth in Monell v. New York City Department of Social

Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), County is liable for all of the injuries sustained by Plaintiff as set forth|
herein. County bears liability because its policies, practices and/or customs were a cause of
Decedent's death and Plaintiffs injuries. County and its officials maintained or permitted one or more
of the following official policies or customs:
a) Failure to provide adequate training and supervision to deputies with respect to the
constitutional limits on the use of an Electronic Control Device;
b) Failure to provide adequate training and supervision to deputies with respect to the

constitutional limits on the use of force, arrests, searches, and detentions;

Case 3:19-cv-03002 Document1 Filed 05/31/19 Page 5 of 15

c) Failure to adequately discipline or retrain deputies involved in misconduct;

d) Selection, retention, and assignation of deputies with demonstrable propensities for
excessive force, violence, dishonesty, and other misconduct;

e) Encouragement of deputies in the belief that they can violate the rights of persons,
such as Plaintiff, with impunity, and that such conduct will not adversely affect their
opportunities for promotion and other employment benefits.;

f) Ratification by the highest levels of authority of the specific unconstitutional acts
alleged in this Complaint and, in particular, the ratification of the unjustified killing of
Decedent.

20. On information and belief, Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, Wang, Watt,
COUNTY and DOES 1-50 knew and/or should have known that prior to the Defendant Deputies
using their Taser on Decedent Okobi, at least two men had been recently killed at the hands of law
enforcement officers within San Mateo County on two separate occasions. The first casualty, 55 year-
old Mr. Ramsay Saad was killed by Redwood City Police Officers just two months before Decedent
Okobi. The second victim, 34 year-old Warren Ragudo was killed by Daly City Police Officers after
being Tased in January of 2018. Mr. Saad and Mr. Ragudo were killed within a mere 10 months
preceding the Decedent’s own death.

21. Tellingly, San Mateo District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe who is charged with
investigating the three taser deaths was quoted in an October 31, 2018 article published in the
Guardian stating “In a county our size, to have three deaths where a Taser was used, it has to raise
concerns for everybody, for law enforcement and for everyone else in the community.”

22, On information and belief, Defendants COUNTY and DOES 1-50 knew and/or should
have known that in the year 2015, at least 50 people died after being Tased by law enforcement
within the United States.

23. On information and belief, Defendants COUNTY and DOES 1-50 received numerous
written warnings, bulletins and/or advisories from Axon, the Taser manufacturer, informing
Defendants about the potential dangers, including death, which can result from repeatedly Tasing

someone.

Case 3:19-cv-03002 Document1 Filed 05/31/19 Page 6 of 15

24. Nevertheless, Defendants COUNTY and DOES 1-50 refused, neglected and/or
willfully ignored the aforementioned warnings and did not provide sufficient training to its Sheriffs
Deputies so as to prevent them from repeatedly Tasing persons they take into custody in an effort to
avoid causing those persons unnecessary and preventable pain, serious physical injury and/or death.

25. On information and belief, Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, Wang, Watt,
and DOES 1-25 were not adequately trained, counseled and warned to avoid making pre-textual
detentions and/or arrests without having reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

26. On information and belief, Defendants COUNTY and DOES 1-50 were aware and/or
should have known that its deputies routinely made pre-textual detentions and/or arrests without
having reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

27. On information and belief, Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, Wang, Watt,
and DOES 1-25 were not adequately trained, counseled and warned to avoid making pre-textual
detentions and/or arrests without having reasonable suspicion or probable cause.

On information and belief, Defendants COUNTY and DOES 1-50 did not adequately train its
deputies on how to make contact with and/or detain persons experiencing mental distress and/or
suffering from a mental illness.

28. On information and belief, Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, Wang, Watt,
and DOES 1-25 were not adequately trained to avoid needlessly escalating situations involving
persons with mental illness and/or disabilities so as to avoid provoke unnecessary violent
confrontations.

29. On information and belief, Defendants COUNTY and DOES 1-50 did not adequately
train, counsel and warn Deputies of the danger of placing persons on their stomach while applying
pressure to their back which can result in positional asphyxiation by impeding the person’s ability to
breathe.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
30. On the afternoon of October 3, 2018, 36 year-old Mr. Chinedu Valentine Okobi was in

downtown Millbrae, California, carrying bags and walking down a sidewalk on or near the 1300

block of El Camino Real. He was unarmed, not on probation or parole and had no wants or warrants
for his detention or arrest. In fact, Mr. Okobi was a father and graduate of Morehouse College.

Sls As Decedent was walking along the sidewalk, Defendant Wang pulled his patrol car
toward the curb and shouted at the Decedent to tell him what Decedent was doing. Defendant Wang
then told Decedent that he wanted to question Decedent on the sidewalk. Decedent quietly answered
Defendant Wang then walked to the intersection, looked out for traffic, and crossed the street. At
some point while following Decedent, Defendant Wang requested additional officers to come to the
scene. Shortly thereafter, Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, and Watt arrived on the scene
in response to Defendant Wang’s call for emergency back-up.

32. As Decedent crossed the intersection he continued to walk on the sidewalk. Defendant
Lorenzatti then approached Decedent and immediately commanded him to get on the ground.
Decedent dropped his bags and put both of his arms in the air. Defendants Weidner, DeMartini,
Lorenzatti, Wang, and Watt surrounded Decedent. Decedent then maneuvered around the deputies
with both of his hands in the air in a clear attempt to avoid being hit and to avoid inadvertently hitting
any of the deputies on the scene.

33, Defendant DeMartini then grabbed Decedent by the arm and proceeded to rip
Decedent’s jacket off of his body. As Decedent tried to get away from the deputies, Defendant Wang
deployed his taser, causing Decedent to fall face first onto the ground. Decedent then got onto his
back and put both of his arms in the air while he was on the ground. Defendants Weidner, DeMartini,
Lorenzatti, Wang, and Watt surrounded Decedent while he was on the ground. Multiple deputies
commanded Decedent to roll over onto his stomach. The deputies were grabbing Decedent’s arms
and legs in an attempt to get him onto his stomach.

34. Without legal cause or justification, as Decedent’s arms were in the air in a surrender
position, Defendant Wang deployed his taser a second time. The deputies watched as Decedent
screamed in agony from the effects of the taser deployment. Confused and in pain, Decedent asked
the deputies, “What did I do?”

35. Without need or legal justification, as Decedent questioned the deputies, Defendant

Wang deployed his taser a third time. Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, Wang, and Watt

watched as Decedent desperately pleaded in agony for the taser deployments to stop. Decedent
screamed multiple times, “get them off me!” as he was being Tased. Still confused, Decedent asked
the deputies once again, “what did I do?” and desperately told the deputies “I’m lost.” Decedent then
exclaimed, “spread the word of God.” A deputy on the scene responded by saying “we will do that.”
With increasing urgency Decedent asked the deputies to remove the Taser prongs by repeatedly

”

yelling in desperation, “get them off me!” Decedent then managed to briefly stand up.

36. As Decedent stood up, without legal cause or justification, Defendant Wang deployed
his taser a fourth time. The unwarranted deployment of the taser caused Decedent to collapse again.
Panicked, Decedent attempted to crawl backwards using his hands while seated on the ground.
Confused and desperate, Decedent repeatedly exclaimed, “somebody help me!”

37. As Decedent begged for help, without cause, Defendant Wang deployed his taser a
fifth time. Decedent then staggered to his feet and crossed the street.

38. As Decedent walked across the street, Defendant Wang deployed his taser a sixth
time. Decedent continued to quickly walk down the street.

39. As Decedent continued to walk away, Defendant Wang deployed his taser a seventh
time.

40. The deputies then tackled Decedent to the ground. Defendant Wang stood up and
attempted to punch Decedent in the head. Defendant Wang drew his OC spray and sprayed it
directly into Decedent’s face.

41. Defendant DeMartini applied pressure to Decedent’s legs while Defendant Lorenzatti
crouched over Decedent with her left knee pressing down on Decedent’s body. Defendant Lorenzatti
delivered a strike to Decedent’s lower body. Defendant Watt bent downward and used his hands to
apply pressure to Decedent’s shoulders. Defendant Weidner then ordered the assembled deputies
multiple times to “Stay on top of him.” The combination of the downward weight and pressure the
Defendants applied to Decedent’s back coupled with forcing him to remain face down on his stomach
impaired his ability to breath and was a significant factor that resulted in Decedent positional

asphyxiating.

Case 3:19-cv-03002 Document1 Filed 05/31/19 Page 9 of 15

42. Nevertheless, the deputies handcuffed Decedent. Even though the deputies realized
Decedent was unresponsive they failed to provide immediately administer emergency medical care.
Defendant Wang’s excessive deployment of his Taser and pepper-spray combined with the manner in
which the deputies physically restrained Mr. Okobi by forcing him to remain face down on his
stomach while applying downward pressure on his back which compromised his ability to breathe.
All of the aforementioned physical force were significant contributing factors which caused Mr.
Okobi’s death.

43. Decedent was noncombative throughout the subject incident. The deputies repeatedly
shouted at Decedent to turn over on his stomach and Defendant Wang repeatedly Tased Decedent
even as it was readily apparent that Decedent was in a confused state and had difficulty turning on his
stomach because of the immobilizing effect of the Taser. Decedent repeatedly screamed in agony as

Defendant Wang continued to needlessly and punitively Tase and pepper-spray him.

44. Decedent's death was proximately caused by the injuries he suffered at the hands of
the Defendants.
45. Plaintiff alleges that reasonable deputies in Defendants’ position would have clearly

been on notice that Decedent did not pose a threat of harm to anyone at the times that he was
needlessly Tased, pepper-sprayed and unreasonably phsycially restrained.

46. The actions and omissions of County and the DOE Defendant San Mateo County
deputies were objectively unreasonable under the circumstances, without legal justification or other
legal right, done under color of law, within the course and scope of their employment as law
enforcement officers and/or public officials, and pursuant to unconstitutional customs, policies and
procedures of County and/or other jurisdictions.

47. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that County and DOES 26-50,
inclusive, breached their duty of care to the public in that they have failed to discipline DOES 1-25.
Their failure to discipline DOES 1-25 inclusive, demonstrates the existence of an entrenched culture,
policy or practice of promoting, tolerating and/or ratifying with deliberate indifference the making of
improper detentions and arrests, the use of excessive and/or deadly force and the fabrication of

official reports to cover up DOES 1-25’s inclusive, misconduct.

Case 3:19-cv-03002 Document1 Filed 05/31/19 Page 10 of 15

48. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that members of the San Mateo
County Sheriff’s Department, including, but not limited to DOES 1-25 and/or each of them, have
individually and/or while acting in concert with one another, engaged in a repeated pattern and
practice of using excessive, arbitrary and/or unreasonable force against individuals, including, but not
limited to Decedent.

49. Plaintiff is informed, believes and therein alleges that County knew or had reason to
know by way of actual or constructive notice of the aforementioned policy, culture, pattern and/or
practice and the complained of conduct and resultant injuries/violations.

50. At all material times, and alternatively, the actions and omissions of each Defendant
were conscience-shocking, reckless, deliberately indifferent to Decedent’s and Plaintiff's rights, and

objectively unreasonable.

DAMAGES

51. As a consequence of Defendants’ violation of Plaintiffs federal civil rights under 42
U.S.C. §1983 and the Fourteenth Amendment, Plaintiff was mentally, and emotionally injured and
damaged as a proximate result of Decedent’s wrongful death, including but not limited to: Plaintiff's
loss of familial relations, Decedent’s society, comfort, protection, companionship, love, affection,
solace, and moral support and financial support.

52. Plaintiff found it necessary to engage the services of private counsel to vindicate the
rights of Decedent and Plaintiffs rights under the law. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of
attorneys’ fees and/or costs pursuant to statute(s) in the event that she is the prevailing party in this

action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 1988.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(42 U.S.C. § 1983)
(Violation of Plaintiff’s 14° Amendment Right to a Familial Relationship)
(Against Defendants Weidner, DeMartini, Lorenzatti, Wang, Watt, and DOES 1-25)

53. Plaintiff hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein paragraphs | through

52 of this Complaint.

Case 3:19-cv-03002 Document1 Filed 05/31/19 Page 11 of 15

54. Plaintiff had a cognizable interest under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the United States Constitution to be free from state actions that deprive her of life,
liberty, or property in such a manner as to shock the conscience, including but not limited to,
unwarranted state interference in Plaintiff's familial relationship with her son, Decedent.

55. Decedent had a cognizable interest under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the United States Constitution to be free from state actions that deprive him of his
right to life, liberty, or property in such a manner as to shock the conscience.

56. As a result of the excessive force by Defendants, Decedent died. Plaintiff was thereby
deprived of her constitutional right of familial relationship with her son, Decedent.

57. Defendants, acting under color of state law, thus violated the Fourteenth Amendment
rights of Plaintiff to be free from unwarranted interference with her familial relationship with
Decedent.

58. The aforementioned actions of Defendants, along with other undiscovered conduct,
shocks the conscience, in that they acted with deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of
Decedent, Plaintiff, and with purpose to harm unrelated to any legitimate law enforcement objective.

59. Defendants, acting under color of state law, thus violated the Fourteenth Amendment
rights of Decedent and Plaintiff.

60. As a direct and proximate cause of the acts of Defendants, Plaintiff suffered extreme
and severe mental anguish and pain and has been injured in mind and body. Plaintiff has also been
deprived of the life-long love, companionship, comfort, support, society, care and sustenance of
Decedent, and will continue to be so deprived for the remainder of her natural life.

61. As a result of the conduct of Defendants, they are liable for Plaintiff's injuries, either
because they were integral participants in the denial of due process, or because they failed to
intervene to prevent these violations.

62. The conduct of Defendants was willful, wanton, malicious, and done with reckless
disregard for the rights and safety of Decedent and Plaintiff.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief as hereinafter set forth.

63. Plaintiff hereby re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein paragraphs | through
62 of this Complaint.

64. On information and belief Defendants’ DOES 1-25 conduct, individually and as San
Mateo County Sheriffs deputies was ratified by County’s Sheriff's Department supervisorial officers
DOES 26-50.

65. Defendants were not disciplined for the killing of Decedent.

66. On and for some time prior to October 3, 2018, (and continuing to the present day)
Defendants, individually and as sheriff's deputies, deprived Plaintiff and Decedent of the rights and
liberties secured to them by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,
in that said defendants and their supervising and managerial employees, agents, and representatives,
acting with gross negligence and with reckless and deliberate indifference to the rights and liberties
of the public in general, and of Plaintiff and Decedent, and of persons in their class, situation and
comparable position in particular, knowingly maintained, enforced and applied an official recognized
custom, policy, and practice of:

a) Employing and retaining as sheriffs deputies and other personnel, including
Defendants, individually and as sheriff's deputies; who at all times material herein
knew or reasonably should have known had dangerous propensities for abusing
their authority and for mistreating citizens by failing to follow written County

regarding these subjects. The policies, customs and practices of Defendants were
done with a deliberate indifference to individuals’ safety and rights; and

h) By failing to properly investigate claims of unlawful detention and excessive force
by County sheriffs deputies.

67. Defendants, individually and as sheriff's deputies, together with various other
officials, whether named or unnamed, had either actual or constructive knowledge of the deficient
policies, practices and customs alleged in the paragraphs above. Despite having knowledge as stated
above these defendants condoned, tolerated and through actions and inactions thereby ratified such
policies. Said defendants also acted with deliberate indifference to the foreseeable effects and
consequences of these policies with respect to the constitutional rights of Decedent, Plaintiff, and
other individuals similarly situated.

68. By perpetrating, sanctioning, tolerating and ratifying the outrageous conduct and other
wrongful acts, Defendants, individually and as sheriff's deputies; acted with an intentional, reckless,

and callous disregard for the life of Decedent. Each of their actions were willful, wanton, oppressive,
