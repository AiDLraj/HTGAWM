George Zimmerman: Um, and this time I was leaving to go to the grocery store and, like I said, I
saw him, um, walking in the neighborhood, the same, in front of the same house that I had called
the police before to come to because this guy leaves his doors unlocked and stuff and, he was
walking leisurely and looking at the houses and, um, so I just pulled my car to the side and I
called the non-emergency line.

Investigator Singleton: _ Okay.

George Zimmerman: Uh, —

Investigator Singleton: Were you, were you, were you armed at this point?

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

Investigator Singleton: You were already armed, okay. /

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am. And, I called the non-emergency line and I just reported that
there was a suspicious person in the neighborhood. Um, the dispatcher, whoever answered the
phone, asked me where they went and I said I wasn't sure because I lost visual of him when he
went in between houses and, uh, he said, “Well, can you tell me what direction he went in," and I
said, "Not really." Um, and then all of a sudden I see him circling my car and, and then he goes
back into the darkness. So, —

Investigator Singleton: **** you pull out of your house and you're heading —

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

investigate Singleton: — you're heading, you're heading down the road as you're looking at
im.

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

009
Investigator Singleton: You're on the phone and he dips between two houses, is that what
you mean?

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am. ‘Cause he —

Investigator Singleton: So, you lose sight of him.

George Zimmerman: Correct and then he comes back out.

Investigator Singleton: Mm hmm. -

George Zimmerman: And circles my car while I'm on the phone with the police.
Investigator Singleton: Okay, is he saying anything to you?

George Zimmerman: I couldn't him. My windows were up.

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: As soon as I saw him coming at me, I rolled up my windows and I stayed
on the phone with dispatch.

Investigator Singleton: Okay, he, your car was running?

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

Investigator Singleton: The lights were on?

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

Investigator Singleton: So he knew somebody was in this car?

George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am. _

Investigator Singleton: And he, is he walking completely around the car?
George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: Um, and, dispatch asked me where he went. I didn't know the name of the
street that I was on. I-

Investigator Singleton: So you'd come off your street and got onto another street.
George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am ****,

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: Goes and cuts through the middle, my neighborhood.
Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: I didn't know the name of the street. Um, or where he went so I got out of

010
my car to look for the street sign and to see if I could see where he cut through so that I could tell
the ****

Investigator Singleton: So after he circled your car he disappeared again?
George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.
Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: Um, then, dispatcher told me that, "Where are you?" and I said, "I'm trying
to find out where he went.". And, he said, we don't need you to do that. And I said, "Okay." Uh,
he said, "We already have a police officer en route." And I said, “All right," and I, I had gone
where, through the dog walk where I normally walk my dog and walked back through to my i
street, the street that loops around and he said, "We already have a police officer on the way," so
I said, "Okay." I told — base said, "Would you like a police officer to meet you?" and I said,
"Yes," and I told him where my car was and the make and the model.

Investigator Singleton: Mm hmm.

George Zimmerman: So, I was walking back through to where my car was and he jumped out
from the bushes and he said, "What the fuck's your problem, homey?" and I got my cell phone
out to call 911 this time.

Investigator Singleton: Mm hmm.

George Zimmerman: And I said, "Hey man, I don't have a problem," and he goes, "No, now you
have a problem," and he punched me in the nose. At that point, I fell down, uh, I tried to defend
myself. He just started punching me in the face and, uh, I started screaming for help. I couldn'
see. I couldn't breathe. Then he-started taking my **** — :

Investigator Singleton: Were you still standing at this point?

George Zimmerman: No, ma'am.

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: I fell to the ground when he punched me the first time.
Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: I, it was dark. I didn't even see him getting ready to punch me. As soon as
he punched me, I fell backwards, um, into the grass and he grabbed me. He was wailing on my
head and I, then I started yelling help. When I started yelling for help, he grabbed my head and
he started hitting my head into the — I, I tried to sit up and I, and yell for help and then he grabbed
my head and started hitting it into the sidewalk. Um, when he started doing that, I slid into the
grass to try and get out from under him and so that he would stop hitting my head into the
sidewalk and I'm still yelling for help. And, I could see people looking and some guy yells out
Tm calling 911 and I said, "Help me, help me. He's killing me." And he puts his hand on my
nose and on my mouth and he says, "You're gonna die tonight," and I don't remember much after
that. I just remem, I couldn't breathe and then he still kept trying to hit my head against the
pavement or I don't know if there was a sign or what it was. So, I just, uh, when I slid, my jacket
and my shirt came up and when he said, "You're gonna die tonight," I felt his hand go down on
my side and I thought he was going for my firearm. So I grabbed it immediately and as he
banged my head again, I just pulled out my firearm and shot him.

O11
Investigator Singleton: Okay. And then what happened? Did he, he, you, you're both on
the ground?

George Zimmerman: I'm on my back.

Investigator Singleton: And he's on top of you?

George Zimmerman: He's on top of me.

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: He's mounted on top of me and I just shot him.

Investigator Singleton: Okay. /
George Zimmerman: And then he falls off and he's like all right, you got it. You got it.
Investigator Singleton: Does he fall to the side and he stays lying on the ground or does —
George Zimmerman: I don't ****, I, my vision was blurry —

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: — and, uh, —

Investigator Singleton: You didn't feel him fall towards you? He somehow ended up to
one side or the other or you don't know?

George Zimmerman: I don't remember. He, I think when I shot him, it might have pushed him -
back but I remember. I didn't know what he was hitting. It felt like he was hitting me with
bricks. So, I remember I, once I shot him, I holstered my firearm, and I got on top of him and I
held him hands down 'cause he was still talking and he, and, uh, I said, "Stay down. Don't
move," and, uh, then somebody comes out and I couldn't see. It was a flashlight in my head so I,
eh, I asked if it was a police officer and he said, no, it was a witness but he was calling the police
and I said, "The police are on their way. They should be here already ‘cause I had called.”

Investigator Singleton: Okay.

George Zimmerman: And, uh, he's like I'm calling the police and I said, "I don't need you to call
the police. I need you to help me with this guy." And, uh, then an officer shows up. Again, he
had a flashlight so I couldn't see him and he asked me, uh, "Who shot this guy," and I said, "I
did," and I put, I immediately put my hands on top of my head and I told the police officer where
my firearm was and then he handcuffed me and took me from there.

Investigator Singleton: Okay, after you, after you shot him, he said, "You got me"?
George Zimmerman: Yeah.

Investigator Singleton: Okay. And then when you got on top, did he say anything else?
George Zimmerman: He said, "Ow, ow."

Investigator Singleton: When he was, okay, um, you said you were, you had walked back
ere.

012
George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.
Investigator Singleton: To try to find out where he went —
George Zimmerman: ****
Investigator Singleton: —and you were already on the phone with dispatch at that point?
George Zimmerman: ****
Investigator Singleton: You said you called them from your car?
George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.
. Investigator Singleton: Okay, so the whole time you were on the phone?
George Zimmerman: Yes, ma'am.

when he jumped out?

George Zimmerman: No.

George Zimmerman: Yes.

was already calling, right? Or while he was **** hitting you?
