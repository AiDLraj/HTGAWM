narrative of, of what occurred from the time you I guess got on the truck to the time —

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: We-
Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: — you **** the truck.

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: We responded to that call, uh, from on the road. We just
returned from another transport. Uh, we were shootin' down **** headed back towards the

056
station when we got the call. Uh, we went, you know, the normal route to Tree View Circle
given our circumstance. Uh, we arrived on scene approximately five minutes after we were
dispatched. There were several, uh, police vehicles already on scene. We were directed to the
rear of the apartment or townhouse building. Um, we were told that we had a shooting victim
and that the police were performing CPR. Upon our arrival that statement appeared to be true.
There were several officers around the victim, or the body, uh, and we arrived on scene. We
placed our **** on him and we found that he was asystole in all leads, and the medic on scene,
Mike Brandy, uh, called it right there and we did a no vitals, no code, and uh, from that point on
we gathered up our equipment that we had brought. Uh, the best I can remember they were, uh,
telling us that they had another patient, um, with the police and he's sitting in the back of a cop,
the police car, and uh, we treated him for, um,.he had one or two lacerations on the back of his
head and what looked to be a, uh, fractured nose, and we cleaned the, the blood off of his head
and face and we treated him best we could, and once the bleeding was under control we left him
with the SPD and we backed out of the scene and we went home. ,

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: ’ Okay. Let's back up just a little bit. Um, when you
guys, the, the victim, the gunshot victim, was that the individual now known as Trayvon Martin?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Yes.
Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay. When you say we **** who is that?

Birefiehtes EMT Kevin O'Rourke: _ I say we as a unit, uh, me and my partner Mike Brandy, so
Rescue 38.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: You and Mike Brandy basically do the medical
treatment on ****?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: We all do the med, uh, the entire, we run calls with both an
engine and a rescue. Uh, the medic on scene is in charge of that medical scene.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay.
Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: However, we're an all hands involved sort of department so

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay.

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: _ — if I'm driving the fire truck or I'm driving the rescue, it
doesn't matter. If I'm on that scene I'm assisting in the medical call, you know, per the
lieutenant's, you know, discretion unless I'm told otherwise.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay, so on this particular, with Mr. Martin, what
did you specifically do?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: _ I got on scene, I grabbed the backboard and the airway bag

and we went down to the scene and I helped pla-, I placed him on the monitor if J remember
correctly and —

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: When, when you say place him on it —
Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: _I place him, I, I put the, uh, stickers on him that check his —
Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay.

057
Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: —his heart and -—

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: . You gotta remember, we —
Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Okay, that's fine.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: I'm not a medic.

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: We don't have to use colloquial speech. Uh, I put the heart,
I put the heart monitor on him and we assessed him and through a lead and that’s what —

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay.

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: That's what I did and then once that was done I
disconnected him and, uh, I walked away from the scene and went to treat, uh, **** Zimmerman.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay. Um, earlier you said that, uh, you put him on
the monitor, and the monitor indicated what? :

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: _Asystole, uh, it's a flatline.
Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Flatline, which indicates no heartbeat whatsoever.

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Which indicates no heartbeat whatsoever, and at that time

we call a what's known as a no vitals, no code, which means he's DOA and we're not, uh, he was
unworkable.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: All right. And uh, the paramedic, Mike Brandy, he
was responsible for making that call, correct?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Yes he was.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay. And that's his job?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: That's his job.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Is he the only one that can make that call?
Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: On scene? Yes. He's, he's, he's the one that can make that
call. I'm sure under certain circumstances a lieutenant could make that call but, you know, we,

we allow our medics to make those calls.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay. So Mr. Martin was never conscious, never
made any statements?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: No. No sir. He was, he was DOA on our arrival.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay. All right. All right. So **** back away

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: T guess when you were placing the pads —
Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Yes.
‘Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: — ete, Did you lift his shirt up, pull his shirt up,
roll his shirt up?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Uh, if I remember T think his shirt was already rolled up.
Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay.

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: _I think they had already disrobed him at the time. We had
been really busy that night and it had been just pouring rain and everything so it was, you know,
it was kind of a blurry scene, and at the time we didn't even have I.D. on the, the guy. I mean, he

was a John Due until several days later. We couldn't get any information on him, so we were,
you know, we were in and out.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Okay. So you backed out of that scene and then you
treated Mr. Zimmerman. :

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Yes, that's correct.

special Agent Supervisor David Lee: - And your treatment of him consisted of just
cleaning up his wounds. .

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: Yeah, you could say that.

don't really —

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: So as far as Mr. Zimmerman's treatment, what
specifically did you do?

Firefighter EMT Kevin O'Rourke: What did I do? I, if I'm, if remember correctly I was, uh,
getting the, you know, pouring hydrogen peroxide on gauze and giving it to Stacy who was
cleaning and I was assisting her in cleaning his wounds, getting the equipment ready for that.

and, uh, replaced all of the gauze in the trauma bag that we used to treat Mr. Zimmerman, just
basically got my truck and equipment back in order and then waited for my, you know, to be

cleared of the scene and then we had to back the truck out because we couldn't pull forward and
we left.

Special Agent Supervisor David Lee: Mm hmm. When you were there with
Mr. Zimmerman did you, when you were treating him did you speak to him, talk to him about his
injuries, ask him if he was hurting or anything like that or?

sorry.

and jeans. I know he had, he was covered in a pretty significant amount of blood, I can tell you
that. I mean, it took a little while to clean him up, but um, as far as his shirt and, I think he was
wearing like a, just pretty much a standard polo shirt I think and some jeans. Uh, I don't really
remember specifics.

maybe 45 percent of him was covered in blood. I mean, he had a, he had a substantial amount of
dried blood on his cheeks and on the back of his head.
