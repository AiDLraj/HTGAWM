IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE
EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, IN AND
FOR SEMINOLE COUNTY, FLORIDA

  

STATE OF FLORIDA,

Plaintiff,
vs. CASE NO.:  2012-001083-CFA
GEORGE ZIMMERMAN,
Defendant. /

DEFENDANT’S SPECIFIC RESPONSE TO STATE’S MOTION IN LIMINE
REGARDING SELF-SERVING HEARSAY STATEMENTS OF DEFENDANT

COMES NOW the Defendant, GEORGE ZIMMERMAN, by and through his
undersigned counsel, and files this response to the state’s motion to exclude self-serving hearsay
statements of defendant and states the following:

On May 10, 2013 the state filed a “generic” motion to exclude self-serving hearsay
statements of the defendant. The motion did not identify any particular statements but it
appeared that the state intended to prevent the defense from offering any of Mr. Zimmerman’s

many recorded statements to law enforcement, verbal statements to co-workers and friends at
some remote time from the event where he explained the circumstances surrounding the shooting
of Trayvon Martin in self-defense. This would include Mr. Zimmerman’s statements that
Trayvon Martin confronted Mr. Zimmerman, punched him in the nose, struck his head on the
concrete sidewalk several times and that Mr. Zimmerman shot Mr. Martin while lying on his

back with Trayvon Martin straddling him. And that while this was happening, Mr. Zimmerman

was yelling for help.

At the hearing on the state’s motion on May 28, 2013, the defense agreed that Mr.
Zimmerman’s exculpatory statements, remote in time, would not be admissible absent proper
evidentiary predicate.

However, in its motion the state also said "Moreover, the statements would not be
admissible as part of the res gestae in the instant case or under any recognized hearsay
exception." At the hearing on May 28, 2013 the defense objected to this broad statement and
explained to the Court that while the defense agreed that there are various statements made by
Mr. Zimmerman that would not be admissible absent a specific showing, there may indeed be res
gestae statements that are admissible and that the defense didn’t want the Court’s Order
excluding self-serving hearsay statements to be construed to include admissible res gestae
statements. The Court was advised that the defense wanted an opportunity to address the res
gestae statements prior to the commencement of the trial. As the Court is aware, res gestae type
statements made soon after an event are admissible notwithstanding that they are hearsay.
Florida Statutes 90.803 (1), (2), and (3). That they may be “self-serving” or exculpatory is not
a reason for exclusion. Alexander v. State, 627 So.2d 35 (1* DCA 1993). Stiles v. State, 672
So.2d 850 (4" DCA 1996).

Witness 13 and his wife heard a commotion in the back of their townhome. They heard
yelling and then heard a shot. Witness 13 grabbed a flashlight and went outside to see what had
happened. Within seconds of the shooting, W13 approached Mr. Zimmerman who was
staggering, bleeding and breathing hard. The witness observed blood on Mr. Zimmerman’s face
and the back of his head consistent with someone having been injured in a fight. Mr.
Zimmerman asked W13 if he was bleeding? Witness 13 said “yes”! and W13 asked Mr.

‘This witness took a picture of the back of Mr. Zimmerman’s head with his cell phone showing
Mr. Zimmerman’s head covered with blood. This was the first picture of Mr. Zimmerman taken

Zimmerman what had happened? Mr. Zimmerman told W13 that the other person was “beating
me up” and he shot him.

Within a minute or so, Sanford Police Officer Tim Smith arrived on foot at the location
where Mr. Zimmerman and W13 were standing”. Officer Smith spoke with Mr. Zimmerman at
the scene upon his arrival. Mr. Zimmerman acknowledged being the person who fired the shot
and that he had a firearm on him. Mr. Zimmerman spontaneously stated that he had yelled for
help and that no one helped him.

Both witnesses were disclosed by the state in discovery and were deposed.

These statements of Mr. Zimmerman are precisely like those found to be admissible in
the cases cited above and are clearly part of the res gestae in the case before the Court. The
statements are admissible pursuant to Florida Statute 90.803 (1), (2), and (3).

WHEREFORE, Mr. Zimmerman respectfully requests this Honorable Court to deny the

state’s motion in limine as to the res gestae statements of Mr. Zimmerman.

Respectfully submitted,

after the shooting. The witness also took a picture of Trayvon Martin lying face down on the
grass in back of another witness’s unit. This was the first picture of Trayvon Martin taken
following the shooting. Both pictures were obtained by law enforcement and are evidence in the
case.

* Mr. Zimmerman had called the police several minutes before and asked that an officer respond
to the Retreat at Twin Lakes community. Officer Smith was en route at the time of the shot.
