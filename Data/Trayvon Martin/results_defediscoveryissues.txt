Bernie,

Following up with some discovery issues:

-The CD you gave us at the evidence viewing containing Wit 9’s two interviews on March 20, 2012
would not play on any of our machines. |'ll bring it with me tomorrow to show you. Please provide
us with another copy.

-As we have discussed, we want to have a complete set of unedited witness interviews. For
example, we noticed that the Wit 9 call to the SPD was 30 seconds longer in the copy that you gave
us at the evidence review than the one you initially gave us in discovery. | can see no reason why
we wouldn't be provided with the complete recordings of all the witnesses and | thought you had
already agreed to that. Obviously, your office has them since, as | understand it, your staff made
the initial edits.

-We would like to have an inventory of the discovery provided to Judge Lester for his in camera
review and how it got to him if you didn’t deliver it to him personally.

-Also, we still don’t have color images of the cell phone pictures taken of the back of Zimmerman’s
head, the flashlight found nearby and of Trayvon Martin laying facedown the night of the
shooting. We only have been provided with black and white photocopies. Witness

took these pictures according to discovery reports and provided them to law enforcement.

-As well, we don’t have the color image of Zimmerman’s face that Ofc. Wagner took at the scene

that was used for identification with neighborhood witnesses. | believe he also took a picture of

Mr. Martin’s face. We don’t’ have a color image of that either. We have only been provided with
a black and white photo copy. | thought you had previously agreed to provide those as well.

-We don’t have the evidence inventory/log from FDLE that you had at the viewing. We need that
in order to move forward with the depos of the FDLE personnel.

-We don’t have the SIM card information from Trayvon Martin’s phone that was downloaded by
FDLE analyst Steve Brenton that he talked about at the evidence viewing, nor have | seen any
report prepared by him. I’m sure there must be a report outlining what he did and what he
couldn’t do with the phone.

-lam still unclear about the sketches various witnesses made during their interviews. At one point
we gave you a list of those we didn’t have. | can’t remember where that stands, | don’t think you
gave us any of them at the evidence review. We need another copy and | apologize if you gave
them to us at the evidence review and I’ve misplaced them. | assume they would be hardcopies
and | can’t find them.

-Several witnesses have been listed “c/o SAO” . | want you to provide us with their actual
addresses so we can conduct our own investigation. | am not opposed to maintaining their privacy
with the public and am not asking you to file a discovery response with their addresses. You can file
a sealed pleading or just give them to us and we will keep the information confidential if you want.

-Much of the interview Mr. Crump did with Carn is unintelligible. | don’t know if the
recording was on tape or digital recorder or how it may have been recorded. Do you have an
original tape of the interview? If so, please bring it with you so we can listen to it on Friday,
perhaps it is better quality than our copy. Do you know if you have the original or if Mr. Crump
retained the original recording and gave you a copy?

Please bring these items/information with you on Friday so we can move discovery along.

| wasn’t clear from our conversation at the evidence viewing whether or not the Facebook
accounts and Twitter accounts of Trayvon Martin and RB have been requested by the
state and are pending. | got the impression that the state has not attempted to retrieve that
information. Please let me know if you plan to do that if you haven't, | believe it may take search
warrant to accomplish.

Also, please advise if you have Trayvon Martin's school records, if so, we would like a copy of
them. As well, do you have Ee: hospital records that would confirm that she was
hospitalized at the time of Trayvon Martin’s wake as she told Mr. Crump and you during your
interviews?

We got the total station diagram and photos, but don’t have the location data captured by the
software. Can you provide the raw data used to prepare the report?

Lastly, with regard to Trayvon Martin’s phone, there is a reference in the reports that Tracy Martin
was asked to provide the password to his son’s phone so law enforcement could gain access to its
contents and Mr. Martin indicated to law enforcement that he wanted to speak with his attorney
first. | can’t find a reference in the reports or in your interview with Mr. Martin that that the issue
was addressed. Are you aware of what happened with that? We want to examine the contents of
the phone and according to the FDLE analyst, it would be a simple thing to do with the password or
even with the email account associated with the phone.

We are planning to go forward with depos on, Thursday, August 30", We plan to depose some SPD
officers and SFD Rescue personnel so we shouldn’t need your help getting them there at this
point. We can work on the logistics on Friday.

Thanks,
Don
