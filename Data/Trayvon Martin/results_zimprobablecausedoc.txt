STATE OF FLORIDA VS. GEORGE ZIMMERMAN
EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT, SEMINOLE COUNTY FLORIDA

AFFIDAVIT OF PROBABLE CAUSE — SECOND DEGREE MURDER

Before me, personally appeared T.C. O’Steen and K.D. Gilbreath, who after
being duly sworn; deposes and says:

Your affiants, Investigators T.C. O’Steen, and Dale Gilbreath are members of the
State Attorney Office — Fourth Judicial Circuit, appointed in this case by State Attorney
Angela B. Corey, who was assigned this case under Executive Order of the Governor
12-72.

Investigator O’Steen was previously employed by the Jacksonville Sheriffs
Office, and has 35 years of law enforcement experience, including 20 years handling
homicide investigations. Investigator Gilbreath was previously employed by the
Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, and has 36 years of law enforcement experience, including
24 years handling homicide investigations.

Your Affiants, along with other law enforcement officials have taken sworn
statements from witnesses, spoken with law enforcement officers who have provided
sworn testimony in reports, reviewed other reports, recorded statements, phone
records, recorded calls to police, photographs, videos, and other documents in detailing
the following:

On Sunday 2/26/12, Trayvon Martin was temporarily living at the Retreat at Twin

Lakes, a gated community in Sanford, Seminole County, Florida. That evening Martin

walked to a nearby 7-11 store where he purchased a can of iced tea and a bag of

skittles. Martin then walked back to and entered the gated community and was on his

‘ way back to the townhouse where he was living when he was profiled by George
Zimmerman. Martin was unarmed and was not committing a crime.

Zimmerman who also lived in the gated community, and was driving his vehicle
observed Martin and assumed Martin was a criminal. Zimmerman felt Martin did not
belong in the gated community and called the police. Zimmerman spoke to the
dispatcher and asked for an officer to respond because Zimmerman perceived that
Martin was acting suspicious. The police dispatcher informed Zimmerman that an
officer was on the way and to wait for the officer.

JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA 32202-3429
During the recorded call Zimmerman made reference to people he felt had
committed and gotten away with break-ins in his neighborhood. Later while talking
about Martin, Zimmerman stated “these assholes, they always get away” and also said
“these fucking punks”.

During this time, Martin was on the phone with a friend and described to her what
was happening. The witness advised that Martin was scared because he was being
followed through the complex by an unknown male and didn’t know why. Martin
attempted to run home but was followed by Zimmerman who didn’t want the person he
falsely assumed was going to commit a crime to get away before the police arrived.
Zimmerman got out of his vehicle and followed Martin. When the police dispatcher
realized Zimmerman was pursuing Martin, he instructed Zimmerman not to do that and
that the responding officer would meet him. Zimmerman disregarded the police
dispatcher and continued to follow Martin who was trying to return to his home.

Zimmerman confronted Martin and a struggle ensued. Witnesses heard people
arguing and what sounded like a struggle. During this time period witnesses heard
numerous calls for help and some of these were recorded in 911 calls to police. Trayvon
Martin’s mother has reviewed the 911 calls and identified the voice crying for help as
Trayvon Martin’s voice.

Zimmerman shot Martin in the chest. When police arrived Zimmerman admitted
shooting Martin. Officers recovered a gun from a holster inside Zimmerman’s
waistband. A fired casing that was recovered at the scene was determined to have been
fired from the firearm.

Assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Bao performed an autopsy and determined that
Martin died from the gunshot wound.

The facts mentioned in this Affidavit are not a complete recitation of all the
pertinent facts and evidence in this case but only are presented for a determination of
Probable Cause for Second Degree Murder.
