IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE EIGHTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT,
IN AND FOR SEMINOLE COUNTY, FLORIDA

STATE OF FLORIDA, CASE NO.: 12-1083-CFA
Plaintiff,
VS.

GEORGE ZIMMERMAN,

Defendant.

CONFIDENTIAL JUROR QUESTIONNAIRE

 

The questionnaire is designed to help the court and the lawyers to select a jury in this case. By
the use of the questionnaire, the process of jury selection will be shortened. | The questions are
not being asked to invade your privacy, but to help select a fair and impartial jury. If there is any

reason why you might not be a completely fair and impartial juror, it is your legal duty and
obligation to tell us so in the questionnaire.

All of the information in the questionnaire will be kept confidential and will not be distributed to
anyone except the attorneys in the case and the judge. To maintain confidentiality, the court will

redact from the completed questionnaire, your name, and any other information that will tend to
reveal your identity.

Please respond to each question as fully and completely as possible. Please keep in mind that
there are no “right” or “wrong” answers, only complete and incomplete answers. If you do not

understand a question, please write “| do not understand”, and the question will be explained to
you in court.

Since the questionnaire is part of the jury selection process, the questions must be answered by
you under penalty of perjury. You must fill out this questionnaire by yourself. Please do not ask

anyone to help you to answer any of the questions. Nor discuss your answers to the
questionnaire with anyone else.

You are instructed not to seek out, read or conduct any research about the Defendant, George
Zimmerman, the deceased, Travyon Martin, or this case. Specifically you must not do any
research using any internet search engine, message boards, chat rooms, blogs, and social

media. Do not read any articles in the newspaper or online and do not listen to any news reports
on the radio or on television.

lf any juror does such research, this would be jury misconduct, all of our time and effort will be
wasted and it will be necessary to start this process all over. Furthermore, if a juror violated this

Order from the Court, the juror will be subjected to Contempt of Court charges, punishable by a
fine and/or jail time.

Please return the completed Juror Questionnaire to the Jury Clerk.
