REVIEW OF DEADLY FORCE INCIDENT: TAMIR RICE

Report of:

Kimberly A. Crawford
Supervisory Special Agent
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Legal Instruction Unit (Retired)

PURPOSE:

The sole purpose of this report is to review the use of deadly force by CPD Officer
Timothy Loehmann from the perspective of the United States Constitution. No opinion is
rendered with respect to Ohio state criminal law or CPD policy.

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

At approximately 3:22 in the afternoon on November 22, 2014, City of Cleveland
Division of Police (CPD) Communication Center received a 911 call advising that there was a
“guy in the park with a pistol, pointing it at people.” The caller, who later identified himself as
“EE” described the individual in question as a black male wearing a camo hat and a grey
jacket with black sleeves. J also stated that the individual was “probably a juvenile” and
the weapon was “probably fake.”

At 3:26 pm, dispatch requested an available unit to respond to a Code 1 at the Cudell
Rec Center (CRC). When Officers Frank Garmback and Timothy Loehmann advised dispatch
they were able to respond, they were informed by dispatch that there was a black male sitting
on a swing in the park by the Youth Center pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at
people. The dispatcher further provided the address of the location and a description of the
clothing worn by the individual with the weapon.

Officers Garmback and Loehmann proceeded to the park in their vehicle, jumped the
curb, traveled across the grass and came to a stop near a gazebo were an individual matching
the description provided by dispatch was standing. Video surveillance at the park shows Officer
Loehmann exiting the vehicle as the individual suspected to be armed reaches toward his right
side waist and lifts his jacket. Within one to two seconds of exiting the vehicle, Officer
Loehmann fired his weapon twice from a distance of 4.5 to 7 feet, striking the individual in the
abdomen. The individual, later determined to be twelve-year-old Tamir Rice, died the following
day of the injuries he sustained. The weapon which was in the possession of Tamir Rice at the
time of the incident was an “airsoft gun” with the orange markings of a toy removed.
CONSTITUTIONAL STANDARD OF REVIEW:

The only constitutional provision at issue when law enforcement officers seize an
individual by using deadly force is the first clause of the Fourth Amendment that provides:

“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated...”

It is significant that the Fourth Amendment does not require a law enforcement officer
to be right when conducting a seizure. Rather, the standard is one of objective reasonableness.
In Graham v. Connor, 490 S.Ct. 386 (1989), the Supreme Court of the United States held that
the determination of the reasonableness of an officer’s decision to use force must be made
from the perspective of an officer on the scene. The Court noted that “officers are often forced
to make split-second judgements-in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly
evolving-about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.” Furthermore,
the Court concluded that the issue must be viewed “from the perspective of a reasonable
officer at the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight...”

The practical effect of the Supreme Court’s decision in Graham v. Connor and other
federal court cases,’ is that those sitting in judgment of an officer’s use of force must view the
relevant facts from the perspective of the law enforcement officer on the scene. Accordingly,
the relevant facts are those facts, and only those facts, that were available to the officer at the
time the decision to use force was made. After acquired information cannot be used to
determine the validity of an officer’s actions. Moreover, because the perspective must be that
of the law enforcement officer on the scene, it is extremely important to look at those relevant
facts through the eyes of an officer trained to recognize and react to a threat.

RELEVANT FACTS:

In light of the foregoing, the only relevant facts are those possessed by Officer
Loehmann at the moment he fired his weapon. At that time, Officer Loehmann was aware that
a 911 caller had reported a man in the park with a gun that he kept pulling from his pants.
When he arrived on the scene, Officer Loehmann observed an individual matching the
description provided by the 911 caller reach to his right side near his waist and pull up his
jacket. Officer Loehmann, who had exited his vehicle, was within 7 feet of the individual and
without cover when he made the decision to use deadly force.

The after acquired information - that the individual was twelve-years-old, and the
weapon in question was an “airsoft gun”- is not relevant to a constitutional review of Officer
Loehmann’s actions. Similarly, the 911 caller’s uncommunicated speculations that the
individual might be a minor and the weapon was “probably fake” cannot be considered.

1See e.g., Smith v. Freland, 954 F.2d 343 (6 Cir. 1992), United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411 (1980), Smith v.
Freland, 954 F.2d 343 (6"" Cir. 1992) and Sherrod v. Berry, 856 F.2d 802 (7"" Cir. 1988).
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TRAINING:

There are two concepts that are universal to all law enforcement training regarding the
use of force: threat identification and action versus reaction.

Human beings are not born recognizing a threat — it is something that must be learned.
For example, without training, many people would not recognize an unarmed individual, or one
armed only with a knife or a club, as posing an extremely serious threat to an officer with a
firearm. The Supreme Court of the United States previously recognized the significance of law
enforcement training by noting “...when used by trained law enforcement officers, objective
facts, meaningless to the untrained, [may permit] inferences and deductions that might well
elude an untrained person.”? Law enforcement officers are trained to recognize that any
confrontation with a person harboring a malicious intent may pose a significant threat if, left
unchecked, they are able to kill or incapacitate the officer and gain access to the officer’s
weapon. Because officers cannot be expected to read the minds of individuals and determine
intent, they are instead trained to scrutinized individuals’ behavior for telltale signs. An
individual’s actions are often the only signals of their intent. Obviously, if the individual being
confronted is reasonably believed to be armed, the officer’s attention to those actions will be
intensified. In such a situation, officers are taught to focus on the hands of the individual.? If
the hands move in the direction of a “high-risk area” — an area where a weapon may be
concealed, such as inside a jacket, towards the waistband of pants, or under the seat of a car,
well trained officers will immediately identify this as a serious threat.

When threat identification is combined with the concept of action versus reaction, an
officer’s need to make split-second judgments with respect to the use of force becomes
evident. Action versus reaction is simply the recognition that there is a certain amount of time
required for every person to recognize a stimulus, formulate a response to that stimulus, and
then carry out that response. When applied to deadly force situations, action versus reaction
refers to the time it takes for an officer to observe the actions of an individual, such as the
movement of an individual’s hands, perceive those actions as threatening, calculate possible
responses to the treat, determine what level of force is necessary, and then complete the
reaction. The reactions of a well-trained officer may be quick, but they are not instantaneous.
The time differential between a threatening action occurring and the ability to respond to that
threat always puts law enforcement officers in the position of having to catch-up. The practical
effect of action versus reaction in deadly force situations is that officers cannot wait to react
until they are absolutely certain of an individual’s malicious intent. If an officer waits to be
certain that the individual reaching into a high-risk area is retrieving a weapon, action versus

3 Patrick and Hall. In Defense of Self and Others, Carolina Academic Press, Durham, NC, 2005, p. 139. “[a] truism
universal throughout law enforcement is that a person’s hands are the source of danger and a clear indicator of
imminent risk.”
reaction dictates that the weapon could easily be used against the officer before he or she has
an opportunity to respond.

APPLICATION TO THE RELEVANT FACTS:

When the concepts of threat identification and action versus reaction are applied to the
relevant facts of this case, it becomes apparent that not only was Officer Loehmann required to
make a split-second decision, but also that his response was a reasonable one.

When Officers Garmback and Loehmann arrived on the scene, Officer Loehmann was on
the passenger side of the vehicle which was within close proximity to Rice. At the time, Rice
was reportedly armed with a handgun, and Officer Loeehmann was without cover. Following
universal training and procedures, Officer Loehmann’s attention would be focused on Rice’s
hands as they moved towards his waist band and lifted his jacket. Unquestionably, the actions
of Rice could reasonably be perceived as a serious threat to Officer Loehmann. Waiting to see if
Rice came out with a firearm would be contrary to action versus reaction training. Considering
Officer Loehmann’s close proximity to Rice and lack of cover, the need to react quickly was
imperative. Delaying the use of force until Officer Loehmann could confirm Rice’s intentions
would not be considered a safe alternative under the circumstances.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

WARNINGS: There is some dispute regarding whether Officer Loeehmann issued any
warnings before he discharged his weapon. While the issuance of warnings (or the lack
thereof) may be considered during a policy or tactical review, it is insignificant to this
constitutional review. The Fourth Amendment permits the use of deadly force in two
situations: when it is reasonably necessary to (1) protect oneself or others from the imminent
threat of death or serious physical injury, or (2) prevent the escape of a dangerous person.
Warnings would never be required in the first (defense of self and others) category. If an
officer’s reasonable perception is that his or another’s life is in imminent danger, delaying the
use of force for the purpose of issuing a warning creates an unreasonable risk. As previously
noted, the concept of action versus reaction already necessarily puts an officer at a
disadvantage. Any further delay caused by issuing a warning (and waiting to determine
whether the warning has been heeded) needlessly increases that risk. Thus, the only time
warnings factor into a determination of reasonableness is when law enforcement officers are
attempting to prevent the escape of a dangerous individual and, even then, warnings are to be
given when feasible.*

AGE: Although he may have looked older, Tamir Rice was only twelve years old at the
time of the fatal shooting. When interviewed, officers who were on the scene shortly after the
incident stated that Rice appeared to be in his late teens or early twenties. However, whether
Rice looked his age or not is irrelevant to the determination of the reasonableness of Officer

4 See, Patrick and Hall, pp143-44.
Loehmann’s actions. Once again, Officer Loehmann had to make a “split-second” decision
regarding the use of force. When he exited the police car, the officer was likely focused on
Rice’s hands as they moved to his waist and lifted his jacket, and not on Rice’s age. Even if
Officer Loeehmann was aware of Rice’s age, it would not have made his use of force
unreasonable. A twelve-year-old with a gun, unquestionably old enough to pull a trigger, poses
a threat equal to that of a full-grown adult in a similar situation. Law enforcement training
often incorporates lessons designed to dispel the notion that minors are harmless. In 1995, the
Department of Justice implemented its new Deadly Force Policy and the FBI subsequently
created interactive video scenarios to illustrate and train FBI Special Agents on the practical
application of this policy. One of the scenarios that was developed required Agents to confront
a mildly handicapped fifteen-year-old with a gun. Most agents faced with this scenario never
recognized either the age or the handicap of the subject because they were focused on his
behavior. Those agents who took note of the subject’s age or handicap and, consequently,
hesitated to use deadly force when appropriate, could not react in a timely manner when the
subject quickly raised the gun and fired several shots - the video screen would go black,
indicating the agent had not survived the confrontation. The purpose of this training scenario
was to illustrate that a firearm in the hands of ANY person capable of pulling the trigger can
pose a serious threat regardless of their physical and mental development. As stated by the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Pena v. Leombruni,> “Very little mentation is required for
deadly action. A rattlesnake is deadly but could not form the mental state required for a
conviction of murder.” This is not to suggest that law enforcement officers would shoot a
toddler with a gun. Most law enforcement officers would rather take a bullet than shoot a
toddler. However, Tamir Rice was not a toddler and, even if his age was known at the time of
the incident, he was perfectly capable of inflicting death or serious physical injury.

REPLICA WEAPON: As previously stated, the fact that the weapon possessed by Rice
was an airsoft gun is not relevant to a review of the reasonableness of Officer Loehmann’s
actions. Officer Loehmann had no information to suggest the weapon was anything but a real
handgun, and the speed with which the confrontation progressed would not give the officer
time to focus on the weapon. Moreover, interviews of the officers who responded to the
shooting suggest that, even if time was not a factor, it would have been extremely difficult if
not impossible to determine that the handgun was a replica. In fact, there have been several
cases where law enforcement offices used deadly force to seize subjects they believed to be
reaching for a firearm, only to determine later that there was no weapon present, not even a
replica. These cases make it clear that “knowledge of facts and circumstances gained after the
fact...has no place in the trial court’s or jury’s post-hoc analysis.””

TACTICS: The question of whether Officers Garmback and Loehmann could have
avoided the situation had they used better tactics is one that is worthy of consideration from
the prospective of policy and training for future events. However, it should not be considered
when determining the constitutionality of the use of force. It could be argued that the officers
enhanced that risk by entering the park and stopping their vehicle so close to a potentially
armed subject. However, this type of “armchair quarterbacking” has no place in determining
the reasonableness of an officers use of force, and is exactly the type of analysis the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appels warned against in Smith v. Freeland® when it stated: “...we must avoid
substituting our personal notions of proper police procedures for the instantaneous decision of
the police officer on the scene. We must never allow the theoretical, sanitized world of our
imagination to replace the dangerous and complex world that policemen face every day.? |n
Plakas v. Drinski,?° the court refused to consider officers’ actions leading up to a deadly
confrontation and rejected the notion that the officers’ tactics preceding the event actually
caused the problem. In doing so, the court made the following statement: “Other than random
attacks, all such cases begin with the decision of a police officer to do something, to help, to
arrest, to inquire. If the officer had decided to do nothing then no force would have been used.
In this sense the police always cause the trouble. But it is trouble which the police officer is
sworn to cause, which society pays him to cause and which, if kept within constitutional limits,
society praises the officer for causing.*4 Support for this position can be found in the Supreme
Court’s decision in California v. Hodari D.,1* wherein the Court held that the Fourth Amendment
only protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures, and a suspect is not seized until he
submits to the police's show of authority or the police subject him to some degree of physical force.’?

In addition to the foregoing case law, it is significant to note that Officers Garmback and
Loehmann received information that there was an armed individual sitting on the swings in the park
outside a recreation center. Considering this an obvious risk to the community, the officers quickly
proceeded to the park in a manner that would take them to the swings. However, when they arrived at
the park and observed there was no one on the swings, it is likely that they continued on until they
spotted an individual matching the 911 callers description. At that time, they were within a few feet of
the pavilion where Rice was located. Whether the officers’ actions were courageous or foolhardy is not
relevant to a constitutional review of the subsequent use of force.

SHOT PLACEMENT: A common misconception often voiced loudly after a lethal law
enforcement shooting is that there was no need to kill the subject, the police could have shot him in the
arm or the leg. Certainly, a large portion of the population subscribes to this belief because of what they
have seen on television and the movies. Unfortunately, Hollywood does not always reflect reality.
Police officers are not trained to “shoot to kill.” Rather, they are trained to shoot to stop an imminent

threat. The quickest, most efficient and practical way for a law enforcement officer to forcibly bring
about a timely halt to threatening actions is to deprive the subject’s brain of the oxygen necessary to
continue conscious action. Because oxygen is carried to the brain by blood, law enforcement officers
are trained to aim for center mass where most of the blood-bearing organs are located. Attempts to
incapacitate by shooting a subject in the arm or leg are not only impractical, they are contrary to
universal law enforcement training.

CONCLUSION:

According to the Supreme Court, the standard that must be used to evaluate a law enforcement
officer’s use of deadly force is one of objective reasonableness. The question is not whether every
officer would have reacted the same way. Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable officer,
confronting the exact same scenario under identical conditions could have concluded that deadly force
was necessary. Based on the proceeding discussion, and in light of my training and experience, it is my
conclusion that Officer Loehmann’s use of deadly force falls within the realm of reasonableness under
the dictates of the Fourth Amendment.
