INTRODUCTION

On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner died during a confrontation with New York City police
officers.

The interaction between Mr. Garner and the police was recorded on a cellular phone.
Ultimately, and before a grand jury heard the evidence in this case, that tape and the findings
of the Medical Examiner’s autopsy of Mr. Garner were widely disseminated. Very few
members of the public had not formed an opinion about the conduct of the police.

A grand jury was convened on September 29, 2014 to examine the evidence
concerning the death of Mr. Garner. On December 3, 2014, the grand jury concluded its
inquiry and did not charge any person with the commission of a crime. Thereafter, the
District Attorney summarized the grand jury’s investigation in a statement authorized by
another judge of this court. No grand jury testimony was disclosed in this statement.

In separate motions, the Public Advocate of the City of New York, the Legal Aid
Society, the New York Civil Liberties Union (hereinafter, NYCLU), the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (hereinafter, NAACP) and the owner
of the New York Post moved this court to release the minutes of the grand jury pursuant to

Criminal Procedure Law § 190.25 (4) (a). The District Attorney opposed the disclosure.

GRAND JURY SECRECY

The Constitution of the State of New York provides that “no person shall be held to
answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime [i.e., a felony] . . . unless on indictment of
a grand jury...” (NY Const ArtI, § 6). Thus, a district attorney may not prosecute a person

for a felony or other crime in the Supreme Court without the acquiescence of a grand jury
. made up of lay jurors. The grand jury’s decision to charge a person is manifested when it
files an indictment with the Supreme Court.

This constitutional provision is implemented by Article 190 of the Criminal Procedure

Page 2 of 12
Law. Pertinent to these motions is the admonition contained in CPL 190.25 (4) (a) that grand
jury proceedings are secret and, in general, no person may disclose the nature or substance
of any grand jury testimony without the written approbation of a court. This prohibition is
enforced by Penal Law § 215.70 which makes it a felony to disclose grand jury testimony.

_ The only exception to this proscription is that a person may disclose the substance of his/her
testimony without approval. CPL 190.25 (4) (a).

Despite these statutory rules, the secrecy of grand jury testimony is not sacrosanct and
the minutes of a grand jury may be divulged, in a court’s discretion, in the appropriate case.
Matter of District Attorney of Suffolk County, 58 NY2d 436 (1983). In general, disclosure
is the exception to the rule. Id. at 444.

The law is bottomed on the “presumption of confidentiality [which] attaches to the
record of grand jury proceedings.” People v Fetcho, 91 NY2d 765, 769 (1998). To
overcome the presumption of confidentiality, a movant must initially demonstrate “a
compelling and particularized need for access to the Grand Jury material.” Matter of District

_. Attorney of Suffolk County, 58 NY2d at 444. This showing is required to demonstrate how

a party has a basis to seek relief from a court. Moreover, the mere fact that disclosure is

sought by a government agency will not necessarily warrant the breach of grand jury secrecy,

nor will the mere general assertion that disclosure will be in the public interest. Matter of
District Attorney of Suffolk County, 58 NY2d at 444-445.

Thus, each movant must first show a “compelling and particularized need” such as to
demonstrate that the party has a greater stake in the disclosure than does any other citizen -
even one critical of the grand jury’s decision. The movant must explain the purpose for
which the party seeks access to the minutes. Id. at 444.

Simply put, what would the movant do with the minutes if the movant got them?

Only after such a showing will a court move on to balance the competing interests in

deciding whether to grant disclosure.

Page 3 of 12
COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL

’ The earlier application of the District Attorney to another judge of this court for a
limited disclosure does not collaterally estop the District Attorney from arguing in these cases
that the movants do not have a “compelling and particularized need” for disclosure.

First, the District Attorney only asked for a limited summary of the work of the grand
jury. No grand jury testimony or the substance of any testimony was released.

More to the point, as will be explained later in this decision, each party must show a
“compelling and particularized need.” Thus, even if the first judge was satisfied that the
District Attorney had established a need for a summary, that decision does not preclude the
District Attorney from opposing these motions or excuse these movants from making the

requisite showing of a “compelling and particularized need.”
“COMPELLING AND PARTICULARIZED NEED”

In those cases in which relief has been granted, the successful movant has
demonstrated a nexus between the grand jury minutes and a “compelling and particularized
need” for those minutes. People v DiNapoli, 27 NY2d 229 (1970) (Public Service
Commission needed the minutes to adjust rates after a grand jury investigation had revealed
evidence of “bid rigging”); Matter of Quinn [Guion], 293 NY 787 (1944) (limited disclosure
was allowed for the purpose of the removal of a village tax collector pursuant to the Public
Officers Law); People ex rel Hirshberg v Board of Supervisors, 251 NY 156 (1929) (a
Commissioner sought reimbursement from the District Attorney for the county); Matter of
Aiani v Donovan, 98 AD3d 972 (2d Dept 2012) (bank records subpoenaed from the United
Arab Emirates for a grand jury investigation, not the minutes, were disclosed where the
movant had no other means to execute on a large civil judgment); Jones v State, 62 AD2d
44 (4" Dept 1978) (statements made by witnesses, not grand jury minutes, were given to the
state police for disciplinary proceedings); Matter of City of Buffalo, 57 AD2d 47 (4" Dept

1977) (the city’s corporation counsel needed grand jury minutes to sue persons who had been

Page 4 of 12
paid for “no show” jobs); Matter of Scotti,.53 AD2d 282 (4 Dept 1976) (limited release to
State Police superintendent and Correction commissioner for disciplinary actions); People
v Lindsey, 188 Misc2d 757 (Cattaraugus County Ct 2001) (in a sixty-five [65] year-old
murder case in which the grand jury minutes had earlier been released by the prosecutor, the
defendant’s son was given access to the minutes to ensure the accuracy of a prospective
movie script); People v Cipolla, 184 Misc2d 880 (Rensselaer County Ct 2000) (in a case in
which the grand jury minutes had earlier been released, the minutes were given to litigants
to further a federal lawsuit); Matter of FOJP Service Corp., 119 Misc2d 287 (Sup Ct, New
York County 1983) (a nonprofit employer sought grand jury minutes to further a “RICO”
civil suit against attorneys who had unethically approached prospective clients); People v
Werfel, 82 Misc2d 1029 (Sup Ct, Queen County 1975) (the New York City Department of
Investigation, tasked with investigating the background of a judicial candidate, sought the
minutes of a grand jury which had heard testimony about a narcotics case of which the
. candidate had been the subject); People v Behan, 37 Misc2d 911 (Onondaga County Ct 1962)
(a special prosecutor appointed to investigate corruption in the prisons was granted access
to grand jury minutes); Matter of Crain, 139 Misc 799 (Court of General Sessions, New York

County 1931) (grand jury minutes were disclosed to a commissioner appointed to investigate

’- judicial corruption).

Thus, in each of these cases, the movants were able to demonstrate a “compelling and
particularized need” for disclosure. Each movant was able to give a specific reason for the
disclosure of the minutes. Each movant could answer the question: What would you do with

_ the minutes if you were given them? Thus, a movant must have a strong reason for
disclosure unique to that movant.

The case law also demonstrates that even movants with law enforcement
responsibilities or governmental authority must also make the same initial showing of a
“compelling and particularized need.”

In the seminal case of Matter of District Attorney of Suffolk County, 58 NY2d 436
(1983), the District Attorney, who had been selected by the Suffolk County legislature to

bring a federal. lawsuit on behalf of the county, was denied access for having failed to

Page 5 of 12
establish a “compelling and particularized need.”

Similarly, in Matter of Hynes, 179 AD2d 760 (2d Dept 1992), the Appellate Division
of the Supreme Court for the Second Judicial Department found wanting the District
Attorney’s request for the release of grand jury minutes to quell community unrest and to
restore confidence in the criminal justice system as “compelling and particularized need[s].”

Of particular note are the efforts by public officials over the years to have the minutes
of the Wyoming County grand jury which investigated the 1971 Attica prison uprising
released. Since 1975, governors and attorneys general of this State have attempted to have
the grand jury minutes released. Matter of Carey, 68 AD2d 220 (4 Dept 1979).

Most recently, Attorney General Schneiderman moved to disclose the minutes of the
grand jury that had been quoted, but redacted, in the “Meyer report.” That report had
concluded, in part, that there had been prosecutorial misjudgments in the investigation. The
court ruled that, even after nearly forty (40) years since the report, the Attorney General’s
contention that the disclosure of the redacted grand jury minutes would inform the public and
complete the historical record did not constitute “compelling and particularized need.”
Matter of Carey, 45 Misc3d 187 (Sup Ct, Wyoming County 2014).

Thus, as with any other movant, a public official, even one with prosecutorial duties,
must make the same showing of a “compelling and particularized need” to obtain the release

of grand jury minutes.
THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE

The Public Advocate has not demonstrated a “compelling and particularized need”
for disclosure of the grand jury minutes.

Although the Public Advocate is a citywide elected official, the Advocate has no
direct role in the criminal justice system. The New York City Charter, in Chapter 2, entitled,
“Council” describes the work of the Public Advocate. Specifically, in section 24, the Public
Advocate is permitted to participate in the discussions of the City Council but may not vote.

The Advocate’s primary function is to receive complaints about, and monitor, city agencies.

Page 6 of 12
By section 24 (k), the Public Advocate must refer any criminal complaint to the Department
of Investigation “or . . . to the appropriate prosecutorial attorney or other law enforcement
agency.” Thus, the Advocate has no explicit role in the city’s criminal justice system. To
the contrary, the Public Advocate is mandated to refer criminal complaints to other
authorities. Clearly, by the provisions of the City Charter, the Public Advocate’s role in
criminal matters is severely circumscribed.

Our criminal justice system is a state, not city, system. The same procedures including
those for the grand jury obtain throughout the state. Thus, the City Council of which the
Public Advocate is a non-voting member cannot enact laws which would alter the New York
State grand jury system.

Counsel for the Public Advocate argued that these minutes are needed to make
recommendations and issue reports regarding police conduct including the use of excessive
force. The Advocate’s request for the minutes in this one, solitary case is undermined by the
fact that the Public Advocate has a myriad of sources for reviewing police actions.

Besides the tape in this case, the Public Advocate, as a monitor of city agencies, has
access to the records of the Department of Investigation, the Civilian Complaint Review
Board, the Police Department and the City’s Law Department which litigates federal lawsuits
against police officers charged with the use of excessive force and other misconduct. Thus,
the Public Advocate has a plethora of sources from which the Advocate can glean evidence
to support her positions regarding the policing of the criminal law in New York City.

The Public Advocate has no “compelling and particularized need” to gain access to
the minutes of the grand jury in this one case to fulfill her Charter responsibilities. Matter
of District Attorney of Suffolk County, 58 NY2d at 444. The Public Advocate’s position in
the constellation of public officials makes the Advocate no different from any other public

official who argues for change in the administration of justice in New York State.

THE LEGAL AID SOCIETY

Page 7 of 12
The Legal Aid Society has not shown a “compelling and particularized need” for the
disclosure of the grand jury minutes.

In its brief, the Society asserted, presumably to show a need for disclosure, that it had
represented Eric Garner. As a matter of law, that representation ended upon his death. See
e.g., People v Drayton, 13 NY3d 902 (2009); People v Mintz, 20 NY2d 770 (1967).

The Society further contended that other of its clients had been adversely impacted
by the events surrounding the death of Eric Garner. Nevertheless, at oral argument, no effect
on other clients was articulated or quantified. The court took the Society’s position at oral
argument to be that the Society needed the grand jury minutes for future reference in
representing clients whose cases will be presented to a grand jury and as a strategic resource.

Clearly, none of these arguments established a “compelling and particularized need”

for the release of these minutes.
THE NYCLU & THE NAACP

The NYCLU and the NAACP have both contended that the disclosure of the grand
jury minutes is necessary to foster transparency and demonstrate fairness to the public. The
statutory phrase “compelling and particularized need” cannot be conflated by ignoring a

_ demonstrable “need” by simply arguing that disclosure per se is compelling. Under the law,
a compelling interest in a case is not a “compelling and particularized need.”

Therefore, these movants have not established a “compelling and particularized need”
for the minutes. Matter of Hynes, 179 AD2d 760 (2d Dept 1992); Matter of Carey, 45
Misc3d 187 (Sup Ct, Wyoming County 2014).

THE NEW YORK POST

Finally, the entity which owns the New York Post has also failed to demonstrate a
“compelling and particularized need” for the minutes. The newspaper would merely publish

all, or part of, the minutes and might use them as grist for its editorial mill.

Page 8 of 12
The Court has not found any case in which the testimony and evidence adduced ina
grand jury has been disseminated to the public by the media.

Journalistic curiosity is simply not a legally cognizable need under the law.

CONCLUSION

Compelling and Particularized Need

Each of the movants has failed to establish that it has the required “compelling and
particularized need” for the grand jury minutes. In every case cited at oral argument or in the
motion papers in which disclosure was granted, there existed a clear nexus between the

- movant’s need and the grand jury minutes.

In summary, the movants in this case merely ask for disclosure for distribution to the
public. This request is not a legally cognizable reason for disclosure.

: What would they use the minutes for? The only answer which the court heard was the
possibility of effecting legislative change. That proffered need is purely speculative and does

not satisfy the requirements of the law.

Balancing Interests

The second part of the analysis would be the balancing of interests which attach to
grand jury proceedings. Of course, this balancing process begins only after a movant has
satisfied the “compelling and particularized need” requirement. Matter of District Attorney
of Suffolk County, 58 NY2d at 444.

Assuming for the sake of argument that one of the movants had established a

* “compelling and particularized need” for disclosure, the balancing of interests would not

have justified disclosure. The disclosure of minutes would have undermined the overriding

Page 9 of 12
oo

concern for the independence of our grand juries. Jd.

In People v DiNapoli, 27 NY2d 229, 235 (1970), the Court of Appeals suggested five
factors for the court to consider'. Only three are arguably applicable in this case.

The shadow of a federal criminal investigation looms over these proceedings.
Presumably, if the United States Department of Justice proceeds, the same witnesses and
evidence will be examined. Revealing the minutes of the state grand jury may place .
witnesses in jeopardy of intimidation or tampering if called to a federal grand jury or toa
federal trial. Witnesses might be approached to adjust or alter their testimony if perceived
to have been too favorable or unfavorable to any of the parties.

In addition, those who were not charged by the grand jury have a reputational stake
in not having their conduct reviewed.again after the grand jury had already exonerated them.

Most important to the integrity and thoroughness of the criminal justice system is the
assurance to witnesses that their testimony and cooperation are not the subject of public

comment or criticism. This concern is particularly cogent in “high publicity cases” where the

_ witnesses’ truthful.and accurate testimony is vital. It is in such notorious cases’ that

witnesses’ cooperation and honesty should be encouraged - not discouraged - for fear of
disclosure.

Ironically, if courts routinely divulged grand jury testimony, disclosure would largely
impact serious and newsworthy cases. It was contended that disclosure in a case such as this
would be no different from disclosure after a defendant had been indicted. This argument
does not justify disclosure. When a defendant is charged with a crime, the secrecy of the
grand jury is trumped by the defendant’s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against
him (US Constitution, Sixth Amendment) and the defendant’s statutory right to discovery

'“Those most frequently mentioned by courts and commentators are these: (1) prevention
of flight by a defendant who is about to be indicted; (2) protection of the grand jurors from
interference from those under investigation; (3) prevention of subornation of perjury and
tampering with prospective witnesses at the trial to be held as a result of any indictment the grand
jury returns; (4) protection of an innocent accused from unfounded accusations if in fact no

_ indictment is returned; and (5) assurance to prospective witnesses that their testimony will be

kept secret so that they will be willing to testify freely.”

Page 10 of 12
pursuant to Article 240 of the Criminal Procedure Law. These mandates would compel a
limited disclosure. However, when no charges are voted by a grand jury, these rights do not
come into play. Thus, this argument fails.

Finally, the decision of the grand jurors in this case was theirs alone, after having
heard all of the evidence, having been instructed on the law and having deliberated.. Their
collective decision should not be impeached by unbridled speculation that the integrity of this

grand jury was impaired in any way.

FINAL CONCLUSION

In this case, based on the arguments of the movants and the current state of the law,
a decision in favor of the movants would constitute an unjustified departure from the plain
statutory language of CPL 190.25 (4) (a) and case law. The movants argue for a “sea
change” in the law governing the disclosure of grand jury minutes. If such a dramatic change
is warranted, that change should be effected by the state legislature. The judiciary is not the
branch of government for statutory repeal or amendments.

CPL 190.25 (4) (a), as interpreted in countless cases over many years, would have
been judicially repealed or modified if courts succumb to the temptation to order disclosure '
in unique or high-publicity cases without reference to clear legal precedent. The law’s
uniformity would be lost and the law would vary from court to court. The ad hoc release of
grand jury minutes would be based on a judge’s subjective decision that a case was of
singular importance or notoriety. If current, clearly articulated law governing the disclosure
of grand jury minutes were abandoned each time a grand jury decision resulted in
controversy, the law would have been changed by a judge. The rules of law established for

the determinations of these motions would have been judicially amended and, in cases like

Page 11 of 12
this one, the exception would have swallowed the rule”. Matter of Carey, 45 Misc3d 187,
213 (Sup Ct, Wyoming County 2014).

It bears repeating that under the law, a “compelling interest” in a case is not a
“compelling or particularized need.” If every newsworthy case were deemed compelling
and, thus’ justified disclosure, the veil of grand jury secrecy would be lifted and every
citizen’s right to have fellow citizens, sitting on a grand jury, check the power of the police
and the prosecutor without pressure from outside influences - real or perceived - would be
imperiled.

Again, in summary, each movant has not established a “compelling and particularized
need” for the release of the grand jury minutes and, if that legally-required showing had been
made, disclosure, on balance, would not have been warranted.

Thus, the motions for disclosure are denied’.

This opinion shall constitute the decision and order of the court.

HON. WILLIAM GARNETT, JC.

2 “At an even more basic level of analysis, this Court must point out that, if the public's
right to know could be a paramount or overriding consideration here, there would not exist a
general rule of grand jury secrecy in the first place. Nor, if the supposed societal benefit of
maximizing the public's awareness could by itself trump all other considerations, would there
exist a legal presumption against disclosure of grand jury evidence, let alone a rule providing
that such presumption may be overcome only by a showing of a particularized and compelling
need for disclosure. To adopt the Attorney General's position in this case would be to effectively
displace the presumption against disclosure of grand jury evidence with a presumption favoring
the earliest and widest public revelation of grand jury material, at least in the most important and
notorious cases.”

3 The NAACP’s motions to recuse and to refer the matter to the Grievance Committee of
the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for the Second Judicial Department are denied as
meritless.
