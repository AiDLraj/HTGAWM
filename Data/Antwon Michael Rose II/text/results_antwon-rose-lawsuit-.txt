NOW COMES Michelle Kenney, individually as the surviving mother of Antwon M.
Rose, II., deceased and as the Personal Representative of the estate of Antwon M. Rose, II. and
Antwon M. Rose, Sr., Individually as the surviving father of Antwon M. Rose, II., deceased,
complaining of Defendants, the city of East Pittsburgh, PA, more particularly the East Pittsburgh
Police Department (“EPPD”), by and through its agent and servant, Michael Rosfeld, individually
and in his official capacity as an East Pittsburgh Police Officer, and for cause would show the
Honorable Court as follows:

L

NATURE OF THE ACTION

1. This is an action brought by the Plaintiffs against Defendants, the city of East
Pittsburgh, PA, more particularly the East Pittsburgh Police Department, by and through its agent
and servant, Michael Rosfeld ("Rosfeld") for his use of excessive and deadly force resulting in the

1
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 2 of 28

unlawful shooting death of Antwon M. Rose, II. (‘Rose’) under the color of law in violation of
his individual rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and in

violation of his civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

2. Plaintiffs allege that the East Pittsburgh, PA (“City of East Pittsburgh’) and its
policymakers, specifically the East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor Louis J. Payne (“Payne’’) and
Chief of Police Lori Fruncek (“Fruncek”) (collectively referred herein as the "Policymakers")
failed to properly train, supervise, screen, discipline, transfer, counsel or otherwise control officers
who are known, or who should have been known, to engage in the use of excessive force and/or
deadly force, including those officers repeatedly accused of such acts. The Policymakers,
specifically the East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor Payne and Chief of Police Fruncek had a
duty, but failed to implement and/or enforce policies, practices and procedures for the EPPD that
respected Antwon M. Rose, II's constitutional rights to assistance and protection. Defendant City
of East Pittsburgh and its Policymakers, specifically the East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor
Payne and Chief of Police Fruncek’s failure to adequately supervise and train Defendant Rosfeld,
implement the necessary policies and the implementation of unconstitutional policies caused
Antwon M. Rose, II.’s unwarranted and excruciating physical and mental anguish and death.
Defendant Rosfeld consciously disregarded the rights of Plaintiffs and Rose, knowing that the
Policymakers would approve and/or ratify his actions. For these civil rights violations and other
causes of action discussed herein, Plaintiffs seek answers and compensation for damages and the

wrongful death of Antwon M. Rose, II.

IV.
FACTS

11. On or about, June 19, 2018 at approximately 8:40 p.m., Rose was one of three
passengers in a vehicle being operated in the area of Grandview Avenue, located in East Pittsburgh.
Defendant Rosfeld was patrolling in and around the same area where the vehicle containing Rose
was an occupant. Defendant Rosfeld activated the lights and sirens of his patrol car, signaling the
vehicle containing Rose to pull over. The vehicle immediately complied and came to a stop near
the 600 block of Grandview Avenue.

12. Without waiting for backup units to arrive, Defendant Rosfeld immediately drew
his weapon and began to shout menacing and hostile orders at the occupants of the vehicle,
including Rose. The tone and demeanor of Defendant Rosfeld was so aggressive that it caused the
occupants of the vehicle to fear for their lives. Moreover, the aggression projected by Defendant
Rosfeld alarmed a nearby witness, Lashaun Livingston, who then made the decision to record the
actions of Defendant Rosfeld.

13. Defendant Rosfeld ordered the occupants of the vehicle, Trevon Robinson, Zai Juan
Hester and Antwon Rose II, out the vehicle as he attempted to allegedly arrest all three suspects
without waiting for the arrival of backup units. Rose alighted from the passenger seat of the vehicle
showing his hands to Defendant Rosfeld who then had his weapon pointed directly at him. Fearing
for his life, Rose attempted to run in the opposite direction of where Defendant Rosfeld stood with
his firearm.

14. Rose did not threaten Defendant Rosfeld or any other person, nor did he make any

threatening gestures that would have given the appearance that he had a weapon or represented a
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 6 of 28

danger to the public. Rose was not armed. Without issuing a verbal warning or attempting any
pursuit whatsoever, Rosfeld immediately fired three rounds, in rapid succession, at his back,
striking his back, the side of his face, and the arm of seventeen year-old Antwon Rose causing him
to collapse to the ground where he laid in extreme pain.

15. Defendant Rosfeld kept his weapon pointed at Rose as he laid on the ground. At no
time did Rosfeld attempt to provide medical aid and/or treatment to Rose who, after some time,
was transferred to the UPMC hospital where he later died of his injuries.

16. Upon information and belief, Defendant Rosfeld was terminated from his previous
position at the University of Pittsburgh Police Department for performing false arrests, assaults,
and falsification of records. Despite his record the EPPD hired Defendant Rosfeld. East Pittsburgh
either knew, or through their lack of a failure to investigate, didn’t know of Rosfeld’s checkered
history, resulting in culpability for such a hire.

17. Moreover, Defendant East Pittsburgh, has admitted that it has no official policies
in place to govern police conduct, the manner in which investigations of critical incidents, such as

officer involved shootings, must be conducted, and the hiring of new officers to the force.

18. Plaintiffs would show that at all times material hereto, the Defendant Rosfeld was

acting under the color of law when he shot and killed Rose.

19. Moreover, no reasonably competent official would have concluded that the actions
of Defendant Rosfeld described herein would not violate Rose's constitutional rights. In other
words, no reasonably prudent police officer under similar circumstances could have believed that

Defendant Rosfeld's conduct was justified nor was the treatment of Rose, reasonable.

20. There is no evidence that the Defendant Rosfeld or anyone else were in danger of

imminent death or great bodily harm. There were no struggles that would indicate that the use of
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 7 of 28

excessive and/or deadly force was justified.

21. Rose posed no risk to Defendant Rosfeld or any other person in the immediate area.
Rose did not attempt to harm Defendant Rosfeld when Defendant Rosfeld shot Rose three (3)

times.

22. Defendant Rosfeld's unlawful and unwarranted acts, lack of training, and the
official customs or practices of the EPPD caused Plaintiffs’ injuries. As a direct and proximate
result of the Defendants’ conduct, the Plaintiffs have sustained substantial damages and pecuniary
loss. The East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor Payne, and Chief of Police Fruncek, knew of
Defendant Rosfeld's erratic behavior and lack of training but did nothing to protect Rose from the
harm he suffered. In the alternative, the East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor Payne, and Chief of

Police Fruncek failed to vet Rosfeld.

23. Defendant Mayor Payne and Chief Fruncek knew that the East Pittsburgh Police
Department had no official guidelines or other standard operating procedures that would guide the

screening, reviewing, and ultimate hiring of new recruits.

24. Rose was seventeen (17) years old when he was killed by Defendant Rosfeld. Rose
was very well liked and respected by his peers. He was in good health, with a reasonable life
expectancy of living at least 67 more years to age 84. He leaves behind his parents.

25. During his lifetime, Rose was industrious and energetic and a good son. He gave
support, advice, counsel, comfort, care, and protection to his parents and family. In all reasonable
probability, he would have continued to do so. Rose was an Advance Placement Honor Roll
Student and had been admitted to college where he planned to pursue a career as a mechanical

engineer or attorney.
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 8 of 28

26. Upon information and belief, at the time of the incident, the EPPD did not have
policies and procedures to aggressively curtail death and/or injuries as a result of the improper use
of deadly force and have not disciplined officers involved in a cover-up of a crime.

V. CAUSES OF ACTION
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
EXCESSIVE FORCE BY DEFENDANT ROSFELD (Individually and in his official
capacity)
COUNT 1-42U.S.C. § 1983

27. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference paragraphs | through 26 as if fully set forth
herein. Plaintiffs would show that Defendant Rosfeld's actions on the occasion in question were
wrongful, malicious and reckless in depriving Rose of his constitutional rights, as alleged more
fully below.

28. Plaintiffs would show that at all times material hereto, Defendant Rosfeld had a
duty to avoid the infliction of unjustified bodily injury to Rose, to protect his bodily integrity and
to not trample on his constitutional rights.

29. Plaintiffs would show that Defendant Rosfeld failed to act as a reasonable officer
would have acted in the same or similar circumstances. That is, Defendant Rosfeld, without
justification or the need to do so, used excessive and deadly force as described above and killed
Rose without legal justification. Rose neither made any threatening gestures, nor uttered any
threatening remarks toward Defendant Rosfeld at the time Rosfeld shot Rose three times in rapid
succession. Rose posed no immediate threat to the safety of Defendant Rosfeld or others when

Rosfeld shot Rose three times.
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 9 of 28

30. Defendant Rosfeld was not provoked when he fired multiple shots at Rose for no
lawful or justifiable reason. Defendant Rosfeld gave no warning or opportunity to comply to such
command prior to shooting Rose. Rose died as a result of the gunshot wound to his body. The
excessive and deadly force used by Defendant Rosfeld was not reasonable, justified nor was it
necessary under the circumstances.

31. Defendant Rosfeld’s actions were not objectively reasonable because he followed
a procedure designed to inflict excessive and deadly force in restraining individuals in a non-life
threatening situation.

32. Plaintiffs would show that Defendant Rosfeld denied Rose of his right to be free
from the use of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States
Constitution.

33s The force used by Defendant Rosfeld was unnecessary, excessive and unreasonable
under the circumstances, as Rose did not pose an immediate threat to the safety of Defendant
Rosfeld or others and the use of such excessive and deadly force was unnecessary. Defendant
Rosfeld embarked on a willful, malicious, reckless and outrageous course of conduct that was
intended to cause and, in fact, caused Rose to suffer extreme and severe mental and emotional
distress, agony and anxiety.

34. Accordingly, Defendant Rosfeld is liable to Plaintiffs for compensatory and
punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs bring this claim both individually and as
successors-in-interest to Decedent. Plaintiffs seek survival damages, including for the nature and
extent of Decedent’s injuries, pre-death pain and suffering, emotional distress, and loss of life and
enjoyment of life, as well as wrongful death damages under this claim. Plaintiffs also seek

attorney’s fees.
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 10 of 28

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask for the entrance of judgment against the Defendants,
individually and jointly, as follows:
a. compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by this Court to be

just, fair and reasonable;

b. punitive damages;
c. prejudgment and post judgment interest;
d. the costs incurred in the prosecution of this matter;
e. reasonable counsel fees; and,
f. such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
appropriate.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

FAILURE TO TRAIN BY THE CITY OF EAST PITTSBURGH, CHIEF LORI
FRUNCEK, MAYOR LOUIS J. PAYNE
COUNT II 42 U.S.C. § 1983

35. Plaintiffs incorporates regarding paragraphs 1 through 34 as if fully set forth herein.
Prior to June 19, 2018, the East Pittsburgh Police Department, Chief Lori Fruncek, and/or Mayor
Louis J. Payne knew or should have known that Defendant Rosfeld exhibited a pattern of escalating
encounters with the public.

36. Defendant Rosfeld was acting under color of law and acting pursuant to customs,
practices and policies of the City of East Pittsburgh and the EPPD in regards to the use of deadly
force as authorized and/or ratified by the Policymakers, specifically the East Pittsburgh City

Council, Mayor Payne and Chief of Police Fruncek.

10
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 11 of 28

3%. Rose was deprived of rights and privileges secured to him by the United States
Constitution and by other laws of the United States, by the City of East, Chief Lori Fruncek, and/or
Mayor Louis J. Payne failed to provide proper training, adequate supervision or discipline in
dealing with individuals such as Rose in violation of 42 U.S.C. §1983 and related provisions of

federal law and in violation of the above cited constitutional provisions.

38. With respect to the claims made the basis of this lawsuit, the City of East Pittsburgh,
Chief Lori Fruncek, Mayor Louis J. Payne, and/or the EPPD failed to adequately train its officers
on how to deal with individuals during an arrest and the subsequent use of deadly force. The
failure to train its officers in a relevant respect reflects a deliberate indifference to the City of East
Pittsburgh, the East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor Payne and Chief of Police Fruncek to the
rights of the City’s inhabitants and is actionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

39. Defendant the City of East Pittsburgh under the direction of the East Pittsburgh City
Council, Mayor Payne and Chief of Police Fruncek developed and maintained a policy of deficient
training of its police force in the use of force, including the proper use of deadly force and dealing
with individuals during an arrest. The EPPD’s training was designed and implemented by Chief
Fruncek under the direction of the Mayor and/or the East Pittsburgh City Council, to act in this
regard.

40. The East Pittsburgh City Council, Mayor Payne and Chief of Police Fruncek’s
failure to provide adequate training to its officers on how to deal with individuals during an arrest
and the subsequent use of deadly force reflect deliberate indifference by the Policymakers and
reckless and conscious disregard for the obvious risk that officers would use excessive or deadly
force on citizens and made the violations of Rose's constitutional rights, including his death, a

reasonable probability.

11
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 12 of 28

41. Plaintiffs would show that Defendant Rosfeld's actions were the result of, or within
the scope of, wrongful and reckless customs, policies, practices and/or procedures for which the
city of East Pittsburgh, EPPD, and Chief Fruncek under the direction of the East Pittsburgh City
Council and or Mayor Louis J. Payne knew or should have known but never provided the requisite
and proper training.

42. On information and belief, Defendant the City of East Pittsburgh, Chief Fruncek,
and/or Mayor Louis J. Payne acting through official policies, practices, and customs, and with
deliberate, callous, and conscious indifference to the constitutional rights of Rose failed to
implement and/or enforce the policies, procedures; and practices necessary to provide
constitutionally adequate protection and assistance to Rose during his struggle to survive and
implemented policies, procedures, and practices which actually interfered with or prevented with
or prevented Rose from receiving the protection, assistance and care he deserved.

43. For instance, the following conduct, policies, and customs, inter alia, by
Defendants violated Rose's constitutional rights:

a. the City of East Pittsburgh and EPPD’s failure to adequately train, supervise or discipline
its officers who commit a wrongful act or attempt to cover-up a wrongful act of a fellow officer;

b. Defendants’ policy on the proper use of deadly force;

c. Defendants’ inadequate training on how to deal with individuals during an arrest;

d. Using deadly force against Rose although he was not an immediate threat to Defendant
Rosfeld or any other person; and

e. the City of East Pittsburgh and EPPD’s failure to review, screen, and/or vet new hires.

44, In addition, Defendant City of East Pittsburgh, Chief Fruncek, Mayor Louis J.

Payne, and/or EPPD, as applicable, failed and refused to implement customs, policies, practices or

12
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 13 of 28

procedures, and failed to train its personnel adequately on the appropriate policies, practices or
procedures regarding the proper use of deadly force. In so doing, Defendant City of East Pittsburgh
knew that it was acting against the clear dictates of current law, and knew that as a direct
consequence of their deliberate decisions, the very situation that occurred -- i.e., Rose's death-- in
all reasonable probability would occur.

45. The City of East Pittsburgh, Chief Fruncek, and/or Mayor Louis J. Payne's failure
to properly train and discipline its deputies was the proximate cause of the violations of Rose's
constitutional rights.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask for the entrance of judgment against the Defendants,
individually and jointly, as follows:

a. compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by this Court to be

just, fair and reasonable;

b. punitive damages;

c. prejudgment and post judgment interest;

d. the costs incurred in the prosecution of this matter;

e. reasonable counsel fees; and,

f. such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
appropriate.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

MUNICIPAL LIABILITY - UNCONSITUTIONAL CUSTOM OR POLICY

COUNT III 42 U.S.C. § 1983

46. Plaintiffs hereby repeat, re-state, incorporate, each and every allegation in
paragraphs | through 45 of this Complaint with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.

47. On and for some time prior June 19, 2018 (and continuing to the present date)
Defendant City of East Pittsburgh deprived Rose of the rights and liberties secured to him by the
Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, in that said defendant and
its supervising, and managerial employees, agents, and representatives, acting with gross
negligence and with reckless and deliberate indifference to the rights and liberties of the public in
general, of Rose, and of persons in his class, situation and comparable position in particular,
knowingly maintained, enforced and applied an official policy recognized by the City of East
Pittsburgh and the East Pittsburgh Police Department.

48. Defendant Rosfeld acted under color of law.

49. Defendant Rosfeld acted pursuant to an expressly adopted official policy or a
longstanding practice or custom of the Defendant City of East Pittsburgh.

50. Defendants City of East Pittsburgh and Rosfeld together with the policymakers,
including the City Council, and supervisors maintained, inter alia, the following unconstitutional

customs, practices, and policies:

a. Using excessive force, including excessive deadly force;
b. Providing inadequate training regarding the use of deadly force;
c. Providing inadequate training regarding the de-escalation of force;

d. Providing inadequate training regarding firing at a non-threatening suspect;

14
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 15 of 28

and

e. Employing and retaining as Officers and other personnel, who Defendant City of
East Pittsburgh, at all times material herein, knew or reasonably should have known had
dangerous propensities for abusing their authority and for mistreating citizens by failing to
follow written East Pittsburgh Police Department policies and for using excessive force;

f. Inadequately supervising, training, controlling, assigning and disciplining East
Pittsburgh police officers and other East Pittsburgh Police Department personnel, including
officers, who Defendant City of East Pittsburgh knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care,
should have known had the aforementioned propensities and character traits.

g. Employing and retaining officers who have been known to be abusive towards
African Americans;

h. Maintaining grossly inadequate procedures for reporting, supervising,
investigating, reviewing, disciplining and controlling the intentional misconduct by all
officers, who are East Police Department officers.

i. Failing to adequately discipline City of East Pittsburgh Officers for the above-
referenced categories of misconduct, including “slaps on the wrist,” discipline that is so slight
as to be out of proportion to the magnitude of the misconduct, and other inadequate discipline
that is tantamount to encouraging misconduct;

j. Refusing to discipline, terminate, or retrain the officers involved, even where
shootings were determined in court to be unconstitutional;

k. Encouraging, accommodating, or facilitating a “blue code of silence,” “blue
shield,” “blue wall,” “blue curtain,” “blue veil,” or simple “code of silence,” pursuant to which
deputies do not report other deputies’ errors, misconduct or crimes. Pursuant to this code of
silence, if questioned about an incident of misconduct involving another deputy, while
following the code, the deputy being questioned will claim ignorance of the other deputies’
wrongdoing;

1. Maintaining a policy of inaction and an attitude of indifference towards soaring

15
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 16 of 28

numbers of police shootings, including failing to discipline, retrain, investigate, terminate, and
recommend criminal prosecution for those who participate in shootings of unarmed people.
m. Having and maintaining an unconstitutional custom and practice of using excessive
force and covering up police misconduct. These customs and practices by the City of East
Pittsburgh were condoned by said defendants in deliberate indifference to the safety and rights

of its civilians, including Plaintiffs, and decedent.

51. By reason of the aforementioned policies and practices of Defendants, Plaintiffs
experienced severe pain and suffering and the loss of their son, for which they are entitled to
recover damages. The aforementioned acts and omissions also caused decedent's pain and
suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, and death.

52. Defendant City of East Pittsburgh together with various other officials, whether
named or unnamed, had either actual or constructive knowledge of the different policies, practices,
and customs alleged in the paragraphs above. Despite having knowledge as stated above, these
defendants condoned, tolerated and through actions and inactions ratified such policies. Said
defendants also acted with deliberate indifference to both the foreseeable effects and consequences
of these policies and to the constitutional rights of Plaintiffs, and other individuals similarly
situated.

53. By perpetuating, sanctioning, tolerating, and ratifying the outrageous conduct and
other wrongful acts, Defendant City of East Pittsburgh, acted with an international, reckless,
callous disregard for the well-being of decedent and his constitutional as well as human rights.
Defendant City of East Pittsburgh, and each of its actions were willful, wanton, oppressive
malicious, fraudulent, and extremely offensive and unconscionable to any person of normal

sensibilities.

16
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 17 of 28

54. Furthermore, the policies, practices, and customs implemented, maintained and still
tolerated by Defendant City of East Pittsburgh, were affirmatively linked to, and were a
significantly influential force behind, the Plaintiffs and the decedent’s injuries.

55. Plaintiffs have also been deprived of the life-long love, companionship, comfort,
support, society, care and sustenance of Decedent, and will continue to be so deprived for the
remainder of their natural lives.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask for the entrance of judgment against the Defendants,
individually and jointly, as follows:

a. compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by this Court to be

just, fair and reasonable;

b. punitive damages;

C prejudgment and post judgment interest;

d. the costs incurred in the prosecution of this matter;

e. reasonable counsel fees; and,

f. such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
appropriate.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
FOURTH AMENDMENT - DENIAL OF MEDICAL CARE
COUNT IV 42 U.S.C. § 1983

56. Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs | through 55 of
this Complaint.

57. Defendant Rosfeld acted under color of law.

58. The denial of medical care by Defendant Rosfeld deprived Decedent of his right to
be secure in his person against unreasonable searches and seizures as guaranteed to Decedent under
the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and applied to state actors by the
Fourteenth Amendment. Defendant Rosfeld did nothing to assist or attempt to save Rose’s life
and critical time elapsed before help finally arrived. Rose was left on the ground after being shot
three (3) times.

59. Defendant Rosfeld knew of the risk of harm that he was enhancing by failing to
provide medical treatment and/or by delaying such treatment.

60. Defendant Rosfeld’s delay in providing medical treatment reflects deliberate
indifference and reckless and conscious disregard for the obvious risk that made the violations of
Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights, a reasonable probability.

61. As a proximate result of Defendants' conduct, Rose suffered injuries and damages
as set forth herein, including great physical pain and emotional distress up to the time of his death,
loss of enjoyment of life, loss of life, and loss of earning capacity.

62. The conduct of Defendant Rosfeld was willful, wanton, malicious, and done with
reckless disregard for the rights and safety of Rose and therefore warrants the imposition of

exemplary and punitive damages as to Defendant Rosfeld.

18
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 19 of 28

63. As a result of his misconduct, Defendant Rosfeld is liable for Rose's injuries,
because he was an active participant or because he failed to prevent these violations.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs ask for the entrance of judgment against the Defendants,
individually and jointly, as follows:
a. compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by this Court to be

just, fair and reasonable;

b. punitive damages;
c. prejudgment and post judgment interest;
d. the costs incurred in the prosecution of this matter;
& reasonable counsel fees; and,
f. such other and further relief as the Court deems just and
appropriate.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

FOURTH AMENDMENT - SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS
COUNT V 42 U.S.C. § 1983

(Against Defendant Rosfeld)

64. Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference herein paragraphs | through
63 of this Complaint as though fully set forth.

65. Defendant Rosfeld acted under the color of law.

66. Defendant Rosfeld, acting under color of state law, and without due process of law,
deprived Plaintiffs of their right to a familial relationship in such a manner as to shock the

conscience by seizing decedent by use of unreasonable, unjustified and deadly force and violence,

19
Case 2:05-mc-02025 Document 995 Filed 08/01/18 Page 20 of 28

causing injuries which resulted in Rose's death, all without provocation and attempted to conceal
his excessive use of force and hide the true cause of decedent's demise to deprive Plaintiffs of their
right to seek redress, all in violation of rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the First,
Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.
