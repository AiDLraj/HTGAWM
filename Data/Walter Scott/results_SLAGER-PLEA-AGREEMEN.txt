FOR THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff
v. Criminal No: 2:16-378

MICHAEL SLAGER,

Defendant.

 

GLOBAL PLEA AGREEMENT

The United States of America, by and through undersigned counsel for the United States,
the Defendant Michael Slager, personally and by and through his counsel, Andrew J. Savage, III,
Shaun C, Kent, and Donald L. McCune, Jr., and the State of South Carolina, represented by
Ninth Judicial Circuit Solicitor Scarlett A. Wilson, hereby enter into the following Plea
Agreement pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure:

1. Defendant's Guilty Plea. The defendant agrees to plead guilty to Count | of the
Indictment charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 242, Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law.
By entering into this Plea Agreement, the defendant admits to willfully committing the charged
offense, and to being guilty of the offense. The defendant agrees that he is pleading guilty to a
crime of violence and, thus, he agrees that he will be detained upon entry of his plea as mandated
by 18 U.S.C. 3143(a)(2).

2. Elements of the Offense. In order to sustain its burden of proof, the Government
is required to prove the following:

a. That, in North Charleston, South Carolina, the defendant deprived Walter
Lamar Scott, Jr., of the right to be free from the unreasonable and excessive

: Ni e0
Is

use of force by a law enforcement officer, a right secured by the Fourth
Amendment to the United States Constitution;

That the defendant acted under color of law;
That the defendant acted willfully; and

That bodily injury or death resulted, or that the offense involved the use of a
dangerous weapon.

3. Maximum Penalties for this Offense

a.

c.

d.

Maximum Term of Imprisonment: Life
No mandatory minimum sentence.
Maximum Fine: $250,000

No mandatory minimum fine.
Supervised Release: 5 years

Special Assessment: $100

4. Factual Basis for the Guilty Plea. The Defendant and the United States agree

that the following facts are accurate, The Defendant and the United States agree that the facts

satisfy all of the elements of the offense set forth in this plea agreement. The parties reserve the

right to bring additional facts to the attention of the Court to be considered for purposes of

determining an appropriate sentence:

On April 4, 2015, Michael Slager was a commissioned police officer with the North

Charleston Police Department (NCPD). Slager was on duty as a police officer when he stopped

Walter Scott’s vehicle after observing that the center brake light was not working. During the

stop, Scott fled the scene on foot. Slager engaged in a foot chase of Scott for approximately 200

yards. During the chase, Slager deployed the probes of his Taser. His first attempt to use his

Taser was unsuccessful in stopping Scott. Slager ultimately caught up to Scott and deployed his

Taser probes a second time.

V2d le
2:16-cr-00378-DCN Date Filed 05/02/17 Entry Number 114 Page 3 of 12

After the second Taser deployment, Scott fell to the ground. Scott managed to get off the
ground and again run away from Slager. The defendant’s Taser dropped to the ground behind
the defendant. As Scott was running away, Slager fired eight shots at him from his department-
issued firearm. During the time that each of the eight shots were fired, Scott was unarmed and
running away from Slager. Five shots hit Scott, all entering from behind. Scott suffered bodily
injury and died on the scene as a result of the injuries from the gunshots.

The defendant used deadly force even though it was objectively unreasonable under the
circumstances. The Defendant acknowledges that his actions were done willfully, that is he

acted voluntarily and intentionally and with specific intent to do something that the law forbids.

5. Application of the Sentencing Guidelines, The parties request that the Court
apply the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) to calculate the applicable sentence
and impose a sentence consistent with the Guidelines and 18 U.S.C. § 3553. The defendant
agrees to waive all constitutional challenges to the validity of the Guidelines. The defendant
understands and acknowledges that the Court will find, by a preponderance of the evidence, the
facts used to determine the offense level and, that in making its findings, the Court may consider
any reliable evidence, including hearsay. Nothing in this section prevents the parties from filing
objections to the Presentence Report prepared by the United States Probation Office, or from
arguing the application of specific sections of the Guidelines. The parties agree that the Court
will determine the final Guideline range. The parties understand that this Plea Agreement binds
the parties only and does not bind the Court. The defendant understands that the government
will advocate for the Court to apply the guidelines for Second Degree Murder and Obstruction of

Justice, and reserves the right to seek a guidelines sentence, up to and including a sentence of life

We Zok (2

imprisonment. The defendant reserves the right to advocate for any sentence he deems

appropriate and the right to request a downward departure and/or downward variance.

6.

Agreements by the United States. In return for the defendant’s plea of guilty as

set forth herein, the United States agrees:

(a)

(b)

(c)

7.

to dismiss, at the time of sentencing, the remaining counts of the Indictment,
specifically those charging the defendant with one count of obstruction of justice,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(3); and one count of use of a firearm during a
crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c).

to not file any additional charges against the defendant arising out of the
facts forming the basis for the crimes charged in the Indictment;

to recommend that the defendant receive a three (3) level reduction in the
applicable offense level under U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 for acceptance of
responsibility. However, the Government will not be required to
recommend an adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility if, after
entering this Plea Agreement, the defendant engages in conduct
inconsistent with accepting responsibility. Thus, by way of example only,
should the defendant falsely deny or falsely attempt to minimize his
involvement in relevant offense conduct, give conflicting statements about
his involvement, fail to pay the special assessment, or participate in
additional criminal conduct, including unlawful personal use of a
controlled substance, the Government will not be required to recommend
an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.

Agreements by the State of South Carolina. In return for the defendant’s plea

of guilty as set forth herein, the State of South Carolina agrees:

a)

(b)

to dismiss, within five days of the acceptance of this guilty plea, the charge
pending in State v. Slager, Case No. 2015-GS-10-3466, subject to re-indictment
if, for any reason caused by the defendant, the agreement is not fulfilled;

to not file any additional charges against the defendant arising out of the
facts forming the basis for the crimes charged in the Indictment.

The defendant agrees that the Solicitor may address the Court at sentencing on

behalf of the State of South Carolina.

8. Agreements by the United States and South Carolina Contingent on
Defendant Abiding by Federal and State Law

The Defendant understands that the United States’ Obligation under Paragraph 6 and the
State of South Carolina’s obligations under Paragraph 7 are expressly contingent upon the
Defendant abiding by federal and state laws. In the event that the Defendant fails to comply with
any of the provisions of this Agreement, either express or implied, the United States and the
State of South Carolina will have the right, at their sole election, to void all of its obligations
under this Agreement and the Defendant will not have any right to withdraw his plea of guilty to
the offense enumerated herein.

9. Sentence to be Determined by the Court. The defendant understands that the
sentence to be imposed will be determined solely by the United States District Judge. The
United States cannot make and has not made any promise or representation as to what sentence
the defendant will receive. Any discussions that the parties might have had about possible
sentences are not binding in any way on the Court, and do not constitute representations about
what the parties will seek, or what the actual sentence will be.

10. Defendant Has Adequately Consulted with His Attorney. The Defendant
represents to the court that he has met with his attorneys, Messrs. McCune, Shealy, Kent and
Savage, on a sufficient number of occasions and for a sufficient period of time to discuss the
Defendant’s case and receive advice; that the Defendant has been truthful with his attorney and
related all information of which the Defendant is aware pertaining to the case; that the Defendant
and his attorney have discussed possible defenses, if any, to the charges in the Indictment
including the existence of any exculpatory or favorable evidence or witnesses, discussed the
Defendant’s right to a public trial by jury or by the Court, the right to the assistance of counsel

throughout the proceedings, the right to call witnesses in the Defendant’s behalf and compel their

\\\ CH (2
Ih
2:16-cr-00378-DCN Date Filed 05/02/17 EntryNumber114 Page 6 of 12

attendance at trial by subpoena, the right to confront and cross-examine the government’s
witnesses, the Defendant’s right to testify in his own behalf, or to remain silent and have no
adverse inferences drawn from his silence; and that the Defendant, with the advice of counsel,
has weighed the relative benefits of a trial by jury or by the Court versus a plea of guilty pursuant
to this Agreement, and has entered this Agreement as a matter of the Defendant’s free and
voluntary choice, and not as a result of pressure or intimidation by any person.

11. Waiver of Appeal and Collateral Attack. The Defendant is aware that 18
US.C. § 3742 and 28 U.S.C. § 2255 afford every defendant certain rights to contest a conviction
and/or sentence. Acknowledging those rights, the Defendant, in exchange for the concessions
made by the Government in this Plea Agreement, waives the right to contest the conviction in
any direct appeal or other post-conviction action, including any proceedings under 28 U.S.C. §
2255. This waiver does not apply to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial
misconduct, or future changes in the law that affect the defendant’s sentence. This agreement
does not affect the rights or obligations of the Government as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3742(b),
nor does it limit the Government in its comments in or responses to any post-sentencing matters.

12. Hyde Amendment Waiver. The defendant further waives any right to seek
attorney’s fees and/or other litigation expenses under the “Hyde Amendment,” Title 18, United
States Code, Section 3006A, and the defendant acknowledges that the Government’s position in
the instant prosecution was not vexatious, frivolous or in bad faith.

13. Waiver of Rights Under Fed. R. Evid. 410: By signing this agreement,
defendant expressly and voluntarily waives the protection of Federal Rule of Evidence 410.
Thus, in the event that he violates the plea agreement or, at any time after signing this agreement,
withdraws his offer to plead guilty, any statements he has made or makes in conjunction with or

following this plea agreement — including the statements contained in the Factual Basis for the

6 Ks bof (2
7
2:16-cr-00378-DCN Date Filed 05/02/17 EntryNumber 114 Page 7 of 12

Guilty Plea, in paragraph 2 above; any statements he makes to law enforcement that are not
covered by a proffer agreement; any re-arraignment colloquies related to this case, any testimony
he gives before a grand jury or another tribunal; and any leads from such statements, testimony,
or colloquies — shall be admissible for all purposes against him in any and all criminal
proceedings. By signing this agreement, Defendant admits that the statements listed above will
be admissible against him for any and all purposes if, for any reason, he fails to plead guilty, his
plea of guilty is voided, or he withdraws his guilty plea.

14. FOIA and Privacy Act Waiver. The defendant waives all rights, whether
asserted directly or by a representative, to request or receive from any department or agency of
the United States any records pertaining to the investigation or prosecution of this case,
including, without limitation, any records that may be sought under the Freedom of Information
Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. The defendant further waives any rights conferred under the Privacy Act of
1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, to prevent or object to the disclosure of records or materials pertaining to
this case.

15. Information Provided by Defendant. The United States agrees not to use new
information the defendant provides about his own criminal conduct, except as specifically
authorized by U.S.S.G. § 1B1.8. This information may be revealed to the Court, but may not be
used against the defendant to determine his applicable Guideline range or to depart above the
applicable Guideline range. Defendant understands and agrees, however, that under U.S.S.G, §
1B1.8, there shall be no such restrictions on the use of the information: (1) previously known to
the United States; (2) revealed to the United States by, or discoverable through, an independent
source; (3) in a prosecution for perjury or giving a false statement; or (4) if the defendant
breaches this Plea Agreement,

The defendant agrees to cooperate fully with the government, and specifically agrees as

He agrees to provide a financial statement on a form approved by the United
States Attorney’s Office that discloses all assets in which he has any interest or
over which he exercises control, directly or indirectly, including those held by a
spouse, nominee, or other third party, as well as any transfer of assets that has
taken place within three years preceding the entry of this Plea Agreement.

He agrees to submit to an examination, prior to and/or after sentencing, that may
be taken under oath, and which may include a polygraph examination.

He acknowledges that any waivers, consents, or releases he signed for purposes of
the Presentence Report extend to the United States Attorney’s Office and to the
Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.

He agrees to not encumber, transfer, or dispose of any monies, property, or assets
under his custody or control, without written approval from the United States
Attorney’s Office.

He understands and agrees that whatever monetary penalties the Court imposes
(including any fine, restitution, assessment, or forfeiture judgment) will be due
and payable immediately and subject to immediate enforcement by the United
States. If the Court imposes a schedule of payments, he understands that the
schedule of payments is merely a minimum schedule of payments and not the
only method, nor a limitation on the methods, available to the United States to
enforce the judgment. If he is incarcerated, he agrees to participate in the Bureau
of Prisons’ Inmate Financial Responsibility Program, regardless of whether the
Court specifically directs participation or imposes a schedule of payments,

If he posted funds as security for his appearance in this case, he authorizes the
Court to release the funds and apply them to satisfy his financial obligations
pursuant to the Court’s judgment.

He waives any requirement for demand of payment on any restitution, fine,
assessment, or forfeiture judgment the Court announces on the record the day of
sentencing.

Withdrawal of Plea Not Permitted. The defendant understands that if the Court

accepts this Plea Agreement, but imposes a sentence with which the defendant does not agree,

the defendant will not be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.

18. Payment of Special Assessment, The defendant understands that a mandatory
special assessment of $100 will be entered against him at the time of sentencing. The defendant
agrees to deliver to the Clerk of the United States District Court payment in the appropriate
amount no later than the day of sentencing. If the defendant fails to make full payment of the
special assessment, the United States will no longer be bound by the provisions contained in this
agreement. The defendant has the burden of establishing an inability to pay the required special
assessment. The parties acknowledge that if the Court finds the defendant is without resources to
pay the special assessment at the time of sentencing, the Court may allow payment during his
period of incarceration.

19. Full Disclosure by United States. The defendant understands that the United
States will provide to the Court and the United States Probation Office all information it deems
relevant to determining the appropriate sentence in this case. This may include information
concerning his background, character, and conduct, including the entirety of his criminal
activities. The defendant understands that these disclosures are not limited to the count of the
Indictment to which he is pleading guilty. The United States may respond to comments he or his
attorney makes, or to positions he or his attorney takes. The United States further reserves its
right to make any recommendations it deems appropriate regarding the disposition of this case,
subject only to any limitations set forth in this Plea Agreement. The defendant also has the right
to provide information concerning the offense and to make recommendations to the Court and
the United States Probation Office as he deems appropriate.

20. Parties to the Agreement, The defendant understands that this Plea Agreement
binds only him, the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of South Carolina, the Civil
Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and the State of South Carolina, and that it

does not bind any other federal, state, or local prosecution authority.

case, the evidence, and this Plea Agreement with his attorney and he is fully satisfied with the
advice and representation his attorney provided. Further, the defendant acknowledges that he

Agreement embodies each and every term of the agreement between the parties. The defendant
